The course is taught via Problem-Based Learning (PBL) methods. As a result, students will direct their own learning by completing group projects related to occupational and rehabilitation biomechanics. The projects will require integration of muscle physiology, neuroscience, and mechanics to analyze normal and pathologic human movements. Specific projects may focus on workplace or home redesigns, fall prevention programs, movement strategy recommendations, and rehabilitation training plans.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "10:00 AM", "end": "11:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "224", "buildingName": "Freer Hall", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "M", "lastName": "Hernandez", "content": "Hernandez, M"}}}}}
