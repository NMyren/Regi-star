In addition, this course will examine both the broader economic and social context in which real estate development is situated as well as how various professions interact within this context. Course assessments will include several case study assignments and a group project using an actual development site that will provide students with the chance to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the course, culminating in a final report and presentation. The overall objective of the course is to provide students with a useful framework for understanding the real estate development process, allowing them to identify viable development opportunities and analyze real estate development projects, while weighing the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits for a community. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
