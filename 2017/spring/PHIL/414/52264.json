Much of political philosophy during the past forty years has been occupied with responding to Rawls. In this course we will do a close and careful reading of A Theory of Justice as well as parts of Rawls's later works, Political Liberalism and Justice as Fairness. The focus will be on Rawls?s theory of distributive justice and the most important criticisms of that theory. In particular, we will assess Rawls's methodology (the debate between real politics and ideal theory) and the normative content of his principles of justice (how much, if any, inequality can be justified).", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "10:00 AM", "end": "10:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MWF", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "J", "lastName": "Bojanowski", "content": "Bojanowski, J"}}}}}
