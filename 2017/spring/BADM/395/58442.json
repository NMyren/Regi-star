The goal of this class is to provide students with hands-on experience making things. Since this is a hands-on class, there are no exams and few lectures. Instead, students will engage in experiential learning, trial and error, and sharing their ideas with others. Each student will be part of a three-person interdisciplinary team (business, design, and engineering). Each team will conceptualize, design, prototype, make, and market a new thing. To do well in this class, you will need to be creative, have an open mind, be comfortable with uncertainty and work well with others.", "sectionFeeAmount": "Making Things Materials Fee $50.00 Flat Fee.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "specialApproval": "Instructor Approval Required", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "05:00 PM", "end": "07:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "W", "roomNumber": "ARR", "buildingName": "Business Instructional Fac", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "A", "lastName": "Rindfleisch", "content": "Rindfleisch, A"}}}}}
