Topic: Assembly of Functional Materials.  Covers fundamental principles and industrial applications of self and directed assembly from molecular, nano-, to macro-scale in all classes of materials, in particular molecular and polymeric materials. Topics include meta-stable liquids, solution phase chemistry and kinetics, interfacial stability, interfacial free energies, nucleation theories, crystal growth, aggregation and other phase separation mechanisms, grain growth and grain boundaries, defects formation, flow-induced assembly and aggregation. Lectures will also introduce application of these fundamental principles in the production of a broad range of materials, such as pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, food products, electronics and solar cells.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "11:00 AM", "end": "12:20 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "370", "buildingName": "Armory", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "Y", "lastName": "Diao", "content": "Diao, Y"}}}}}
