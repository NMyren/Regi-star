Within the US, immigration, migration, and gender and racial differences have been major trends shaping workplace composition.  Globalization places additional pressures on managing workplace diversity effectively. In this setting, training managers and human resource professionals to manage differences and adapt to multiple national and cultural contexts is an imperative. Course provides an in-depth understanding of how managers and HR professionals can be effective in not only managing diversity in a global context, but also in leveraging global diversity as a competitive advantage.
