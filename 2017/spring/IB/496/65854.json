During the course we will cover four focus areas: locomotion, sensing, materials, and complex systems. For each topic, we will discuss the state of the art on engineering side and the solutions in nature that can augment the current engineering systems. By the end of the course you should be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, use analogical design concepts, and produce a prototype based on a biological function to solve an engineering challenge in one of the four focus areas.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "12:00 PM", "end": "12:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MWF", "instructors": {"instructor": [{"firstName": "M", "lastName": "Alleyne", "content": "Alleyne, M"}, {"firstName": "A", "lastName": "Wissa", "content": "Wissa, A"}]}}}}
