By the end of the first week you will calculate the trajectory of a relativistic starship and confirm an insight of Ramanujan, the \"Man Who Knew Infinity.\" A week after that you will generate diagrams of spacetime curvature around black holes. You will determine the slingshot trajectory for a tour of the gas giants and calculate pi using simulated toothpicks. There will be chaos, and fractal geometry, and pattern recognition in noisy environments. You will learn that a Python is not just a snake, nor a Spyder just an arachnid. And you will be pioneers: you are going to help us change the way we teach undergraduate physics at the University of Illinois.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "04:00 PM", "end": "05:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "R", "roomNumber": "276", "buildingName": "Loomis Laboratory", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "G", "lastName": "Gollin", "content": "Gollin, G"}}}}}
