In this course you will receive training in bimodal systems biology: (1) Translating experimental observations to mathematical representations. (2) Deterministic network model development, mathematical solution techniques, simulation, and prediction. These approaches will be presented in the context of tumor angiogenesis. Here students will examine the angiogenic signaling pathways, and apply systems biology and bioengineering approaches to design new therapeutics targeting tumor vasculature. **Pre-reqs: MCB 150 and one of the following courses: BIOE 201, CHBE 221, or TAM 210/212.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "12:30 PM", "end": "01:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "1103", "buildingName": "Siebel Center for Comp Sci", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "P", "lastName": "Imoukhuede", "content": "Imoukhuede, P"}}}}}
