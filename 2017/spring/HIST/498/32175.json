Title: The Age of Democratic Revolustions:  1775-1825 Topid:  What is a revolution? Why was there a wave of revolutions and independence movements in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries?  Historians call this an age of revolutions, but to what extent were the revolutions included in it similar or different?  In this seminar, we will explore the answers to these questions and more.  After first defining the period of AtlanticRevolutions, we will cover the American, French, Haitian, and Latin American Revolutions and their ramifications in the wider world.  Students will be introduced to relevant primary source databases available through our library such as online newspapers and pamphlet literature, as well as printed sources and online digitized archives.  Students will develop a research project addressing some aspect of this period, broadly speaking, that is relevant to their interests.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "DIS", "content": "Discussion/Recitation"}, "start": "01:00 PM", "end": "02:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "R", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "H", "lastName": "Freund", "content": "Freund, H"}}}}}
