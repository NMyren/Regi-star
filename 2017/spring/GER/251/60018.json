Fairy Tales in Context   Students read classical and little-known tales from the Grimms? 19th-century collections, as well as earlier tales and other texts, focusing on how power, gender, race, class, and ecological issues play out in these surprisingly dense, meaningful, and very old stories. Why do we continue to tell these tales? Why do certain stories recur again and again, in Western and other cultures? The power of narrative is at the center of our lives, and of these tales, and by the end of the semester we will understand this power much better.   This course fulfills General Education requirements in Literature and the Arts, and in Western and Comparative Culture.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "DIS", "content": "Discussion/Recitation"}, "start": "11:00 AM", "end": "11:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "F", "roomNumber": "1136", "buildingName": "Foreign Languages Building", "instructors": {"instructor": [{"firstName": "L", "lastName": "Johnson", "content": "Johnson, L"}, {"firstName": "S", "lastName": "Stoeckl", "content": "Stoeckl, S"}]}}}}
