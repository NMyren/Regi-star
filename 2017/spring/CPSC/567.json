In systems biology, advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and structural biology are used to generate global and unified views that integrate fragmentary knowledge of biological systems, their components and their interrelationships. This course is intended for students interested in the crossroads of biology and computational science and includes both lectures and hands-on experience. Same as IB 505.
