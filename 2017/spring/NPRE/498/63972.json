The intermittence of renewable systems mandates the development of efficient energy stoarge and backups as well as conveyance systems for their effective implementation.  Exhaustive coverage of energy storage technologies including:  battery technologies encompassing primary and secondary electrochemical cells; lead acid, nickel-based, Li-ion batteries; advanced battery systems including redox/flow batteries, sulfur-sodium; hydrogen electrochemical cells and regenerative fuel cells including hydride storages; mechanical energy storage including flywheel, compressed-air and pumped hydraulic storage; thermal and chemical storage based on phase-change and medium enthalphy-change reversible chemical reactions; and inductive stoage in super capacitors and magnetic using superconducting magnets are covered.  Social and economic aspects of storage technology and specific new development in stoarge technology are covered.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "01:00 PM", "end": "01:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MWF", "roomNumber": "100H", "buildingName": "Talbot Laboratory", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "M", "lastName": "Ragheb", "content": "Ragheb, M"}}}}}
