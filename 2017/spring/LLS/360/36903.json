The course centers on the early 20th Century (Lydia Mendoza, Leonor Villegas de Magnon) as well at the more classical Chicana/Chicano Civil Rights Movement (Joan Baez, Dolores Huerta), and the new crop of memoir and autobiograpy, as represented in the most recent texts by well-established Chicana writers, such as Sandra Cisneros, Gloria Anzaldua and Ana Castillo. We will also discuss the professionalization of the field of Latina/Latino Studies in the work of Tey Diana Rebolledo. Additionally, students will study the writing of self with a focus on gender, sexuality, and genre. Historical periods to be covered include the Mexican Revolution, the Civil Rights Movement, and 9/11.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "09:30 AM", "end": "10:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "103", "buildingName": "1207 W Oregon", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "R", "lastName": "Romero", "content": "Romero, R"}}}}}
