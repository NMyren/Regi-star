It?s the engine of angels or the cudgel of demons.  But of course, English is not simply one or the other of these things.  Over time, it has been lots of different things to lots of different people.  And the purpose of this course will be to explore those uses and users throughout the history of the English language in order to answer the following questions:  What is English?  What does it look like?  Who uses it?  Where is it used? What does it mean to use it?  Readings for the course will include primary texts (in Old, Middle, Early Modern, and Present Day Englishes) as well as contemporary histories of the language.  Coursework will include lectures, discussions, presentations, exams, and short essays.  No prior knowledge of historical Englishes or linguistics is necessary.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "02:00 PM", "end": "03:15 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MW", "roomNumber": "119", "buildingName": "English Building", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "L", "lastName": "Russell", "content": "Russell, L"}}}}}
