It considers what profanity looks like, who uses it, what it is used to accomplish (pragmatically and aesthetically), who and what it most often targets (with special consideration of religion, ethnicity, race, class, embodiment, disability, gender, and sexuality), and what circumstances allow for its reclamation or recuperation.  The course explores when and why profanity comes into and falls out of fashion by asking how profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity are socially constructed, within historical and political climates and through institutional and cultural mechanisms.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "S1 ", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "10:00 AM", "end": "11:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "M", "roomNumber": "113", "buildingName": "English Building", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "L", "lastName": "Russell", "content": "Russell, L"}}}}}
