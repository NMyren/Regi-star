While our primary focus will be writing program work at the first-year/general education level, we will also consider allied sites of writing, such as writing centers and WAC/WID programs. We will examine and interrogate?as well as experiment with?methodologies for policy creation and maintenance, data collection and research, and archival practices in program administration, in addition to examining the theories informing those methods.   By the end of the seminar, students will be able to (1) Locate and situate key institutional and curricular issues facing writing program administrators (WPAs) today; (2) Understand the historical conditions under which WPAs have labored and how those histories affect current WPA theory and practice; (3) Differentiate between multiple theories of leadership, management, and administration, including those rooted in collaborative models; and (4) Articulate the relationship between the intellectual work of writing program administration and sound program leadership.  Writing assignments for the seminar tentatively include an extended case study, policy analysis, critical book review, and a job ?package? (statement of administrative philosophy, mock job letter, and accompanying materials). In addition, active participation and deep engagement with weekly readings is expected. This course is open to MA and PhD students in English/Writing Studies as well as graduate students from outside the department, however, students from outside English are strongly encouraged to consult with the instructor before registering.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "01:00 PM", "end": "02:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "T", "roomNumber": "123", "buildingName": "English Building", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "K", "lastName": "Ritter", "content": "Ritter, K"}}}}}
