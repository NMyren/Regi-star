It is offered through the Living in Residence Program at Allen Hall. The focus is on the acquisition of beginning-level vocabulary items and grammar of ASL. ASL is a non-Indo-European language that uses the visual/manual rather than spoken/auditory modality. Students develop a core vocabulary and basic grammar to enable you to communicate using ASL. The Deaf Community, like other cultural groups, defines a population that shares both a language and pattern of transmission of beliefs and values. The course provides an introduction to the culture, traditions, and values of the Deaf Community.", "creditHours": "2 hours.", "sections": {"section": [{"href": "http://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2017/spring/SHS/111/56990.xml", "id": "56990", "content": "U12"}, {"href": "http://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2017/spring/SHS/111/56991.xml", "id": "56991", "content": "WE1"}]}}
