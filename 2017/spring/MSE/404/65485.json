Hands-on experience with popular microscopic computational materials science and engineering software through project-based learning in electronic structure calculation (Quantum Espresso) and finite element modeling (OOF2). Students will also develop proficiency in the command line interface and bash shell scripting. The course will prioritize the physical principles underlying the software to confer an understanding of their applicability and limitations, and hands-on immersive praxis to give students the confidence and expertise to independently use these tools.", "partOfTerm": "A", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-03-10-06:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "B1 ", "content": "Laboratory"}, "start": "02:00 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "D", "lastName": "Trinkle", "content": "Trinkle, D"}}}}}
