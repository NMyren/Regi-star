While it has long been central in the development of knowledge practices and data collection in the modern sciences, new information infrastructures have extended potentials for knowledge sharing and learning across communities of difference in diverse fields. This course will explore the politics of design and collaboration in knowledge work, considering the continuing promise and problem that surround distributed collaboration in data collection, archive building, and analysis - but that now express themselves in new inter-disciplinary ventures (including biodiversity informatics, para-taxonomy, and big data itself) that invite distinct forms of global participation from diverse lay-experts and publics. Key to the course will be a consideration of emergent experiments in design and collaborative interventions by transnational hacktivist groups, global citizen labs, and lay science networks.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "01:30 PM", "end": "04:20 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "M", "roomNumber": "336", "buildingName": "Gregory Hall", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "A", "lastName": "Chan", "content": "Chan, A"}}}}}
