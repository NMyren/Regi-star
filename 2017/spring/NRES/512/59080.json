The concept of environmental governance has arisen to characterize a wide array of interventions seeking to change incentives, knowledge, institutions, and behavior related to the environment.  But what is environmental governance? How is it distinctive from governance?  How does governance operate to shape environmental outcomes? And how might we observe and measure its effects?   This graduate reading course will seek to answer these questions by exploring parts of the broad literature on this topic.  Readings will be drawn from political science, public policy, geography, and interdisciplinary environmental studies. The course will examine governance primarily in relation to the environmental issues of biodiversity conservation, forest management, and climate change.  We will explore how governance works in and across international, national, and sub-national levels.  Interactions across scales, especially relating to international aid interventions, will be of particular interest.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "CNF", "content": "Conference"}, "start": "04:00 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "T", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "D", "lastName": "Miller", "content": "Miller, D"}}}}}
