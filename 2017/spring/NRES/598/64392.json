This course is designed to provide graduate students with the tools necessary to estimate wildlife population parameters in a rigorous and robust manner.  We will attempt to employ an interactive classroom to present the tools researchers and managers employ to address questions in population ecology and conservation. The beginning of the course will focus on the general philosophies of scientific research and management.  We will then focus on 5 major topics in the estimation and management of wildlife populations: 1) Neutral models, 2) Presence/absence, 3) Abundance estimation, 4) Survival estimation, and 5) Bayesian Methodology.  Finally, we will emphasize the applied nature of these tools, including model building, selection, and inference, and their application in probabilistic decision analysis (Bayesian Belief Networks).", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LAB", "content": "Laboratory"}, "start": "12:00 PM", "end": "01:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "instructors": {"instructor": [{"firstName": "T", "lastName": "Benson", "content": "Benson, T"}, {"firstName": "K", "lastName": "Stodola", "content": "Stodola, K"}]}}}}
