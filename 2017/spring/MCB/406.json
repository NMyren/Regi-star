Lectures are centered on the principles of regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The course covers macromolecule structure and function in gene expression; molecular mechanisms of the key gene expression events including transcription, RNA processing, localization and translation. Applications of these principles in medicine and therapeutics such as aging, cancer and drug design are also discussed. Same as BIOC 406. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours.
