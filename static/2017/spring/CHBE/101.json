    "description": "Tells the stories of everyday objects: bathtubs, pop cans and screws. These simple objects shape our lives, yet are engineering masterpieces. To unveil this hidden world the course uses a humanistic approach. Designed to appeal to all majors, it uses human stories - filled with failures and triumphs - to reveal the methods of engineers. The course enchants with tales of ancient steel making, today's pop cans, huge stone monuments, and salt. The course will change how a student looks at his or her world. Several sessions focus on women engineers and the environment.",
