Covers fundamental principles and industrial applications of self and directed assembly from molecular, nano-, to macro-scale in all classes of materials, in particular molecular and polymeric materials. Topics include meta-stable liquids, solution phase chemistry and kinetics, interfacial stability, interfacial free energies, nucleation theories, crystal growth, aggregation and other phase separation mechanisms, grain growth and grain boundaries, defects formation, flow-induced assembly and aggregation. Lectures will also introduce application of these fundamental principles in the production of a broad range of materials, such as pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, food products, electronics and solar cells.",
