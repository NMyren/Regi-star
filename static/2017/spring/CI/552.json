{"creditHours":"4 hours.","description":"Focuses on analysis of data and writing of qualitative/ethnographic research in educational contexts. Topics include the history of qualitative research practices; approaches to the analysis and interpretation of multiple forms of data, including coding, discourse analysis, text analysis, and structural/post-structural analysis; different styles of qualitative writing; social theory as a framing device; and writing for publication. Provides a theoretically informed but very practical, hands-on approach to qualitative writing for graduate researchers across the broad range of educational and social science contexts. One part of the course focuses on methods of analysis through application, while a second part is designed as a writer's workshop in which students \"write up\" the data from a study in three narrative styles. Assignments include weekly readings, three short writing assignments, and a more substantial writing project. Advanced graduate standing is useful but not required.","href":"/2017/spring/CI/552.json","id":"CI 552","label":"Qualitative Writing","parents":{"calendarYear":{"href":"/2017.json","id":"2017","label":"2017"},"subject":{"href":"/2017/spring/CI.json","id":"CI","label":"Curriculum and Instruction"},"term":{"href":"/2017/spring.json","id":"120171","label":"Spring 2017"}},"sections":[{"href":"/2017/spring/CI/552/57745.json","id":"57745","label":"A"}]}
