The goal is to learn as much about another culture and language as we can in order to learn about ourselves as future teachers. Spending time in schools in another culture helps us understand what it is like to be culturally different in US schools and thus to be more culturally sensitive teachers.  Interested students should contact the instructor at marilynj@illinois.edu.  Pre tour meets throughout the semester at arranged times and days.    This is a 2 credit hour course.","sectionTitle":"Argentina Study Abroad","specialApproval":"Instructor Approval Required","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
