THIS SECTION WILL MEET IN ROOM 16 OF THE EDUCATION BUILDING.  We will critically reflect on the topic of second-language literacy by examining its epistemological and theoretical foundations, as well as the questions, methods, and analyses used in empirical research. Through examples from schools and non-formal settings, we will explore how learners? first language(s) and language varieties influence and contribute to development of literacy in second/additional languages. The course focuses on learners in grades 4-12; students of early childhood, family, and adult education are also welcome! Designed for doctoral and highly motivated master students interested in second language literacy and biliteracy research in and outside the U.S.",
