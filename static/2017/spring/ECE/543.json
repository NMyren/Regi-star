{"courseSectionInformation":"4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: ECE 534 or equivalent.","creditHours":"4 hours.","description":"Advanced graduate course on modern probabilistic theory of adaptive and learning systems. The following topics will be covered; basics of statistical decision theory; concentration inequalities; supervised and unsupervised learning; empirical risk minimization; complexity-regularized estimation; generalization bounds for learning algorithms; VC dimension and Rademacher complexities; minimax lower bounds; online learning and optimization. Along with the general theory, the course will discuss applications of statistical learning theory to signal processing, information theory, and adaptive control. Basic prerequisites include probability and random processes, calculus, and linear algebra. Other necessary material and background will be introduced as needed. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.
