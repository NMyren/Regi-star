    "description": "Mathematical models of linguistic structure and their implementation in computational algorithms used in automatic speech understanding and speech synthesis. Statistical and automata-theoretic techniques are studied allowing a quantitative description of acoustic-phonetics, phonology, phonotactics, lexicons, syntax, and semantics. The methods are used to build components of a speech understanding system. For 4 hours credit, an extended project is required. Prerequisite: ECE 537.",
