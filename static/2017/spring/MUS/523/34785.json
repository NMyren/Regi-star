The root of this study is the humoral theory of the body, which in various forms dominated medical across Europe and the Middle East for millennia and which in both Christian and Islamic contexts interacted with conceptions of the senses to influence artworks of many different media. From there, we will also explore the similarities and differences between the artful medicine or healing art produced within the humoral framework to that produced under other paradigms such as those operating in the same period within India and east Asia.Meets with MDVL 500/523B","sectionTitle":"Medieval Medicine and the Arts","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
