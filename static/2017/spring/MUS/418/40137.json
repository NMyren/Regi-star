This course explores music and social interchange across the African continent, placing emphasis on recent changes beginning just prior to the turn of the 21st century. On the one hand, we will examine international and transnational trends across regions, exemplified in part by the discourse associated with Afropolitanism, an idea akin to African-centered cosmopolitanism. While on the other, we will survey local traditions that continue to be viewed as subaltern as a result of dominant, albeit African-centered, discourses. Drawing from scholarly and popular sources, we will focus on musical practices found in Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Malawi.","sectionTitle":"Mus & Soc Intrchng in Africa","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
