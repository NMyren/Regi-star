The goal is to strengthen the link between science curricula and students? interests and individual needs, through: 1) using students' interests as the starting and focal points to guide the content of the course, 2) creating a supportive and communicative learning environment using peer mentoring and the structure of a scientific research group as cornerstones in the curricular design, and 3) emphasizing the individual experiences and anticipating needs of the students while encouraging students to engage in authentic scientific research as undergraduates. The Chemsitry course is delivered through a series of programs and activities, including skill lectures on scientific literature and research, peer mentoring, small group meetings, literature reviews, special topics discussions on science and public policy, technical writing seminars, and research investigation.",
