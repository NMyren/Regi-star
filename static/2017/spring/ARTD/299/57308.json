Through the study, exposure, and immersion into Japanese aesthetics and culture, it is hoped that students will acquire a better understanding of how the idea of beauty permeates through many aspects of Japanese culture and how these ideals may be applied to their own work, interactions, and understanding of their own surroundings. Students will be exposed to Chado (the Japanese Way of Tea); Ikebana (Japanese Flower Arrangement); shodo (Japanese calligraphy) and Japanese cooking. Guest instructors will include Professor Kimiko Gunji and Professor Shozo Sato. Open to campus, no restrictions.",
