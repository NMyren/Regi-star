    "sectionText": "Hispanic families have many strengths that can battle their risks for poor health outcomes. This course will train Spanish-speaking undergraduate students in the research and professional skills necessary to implement a community health promotion program in Hispanic children and their families: ''Abriendo Caminos''. The program includes implementation of culturally appropriate nutrition education modules.  Students will participate directly in research, program adaptation, and material development experiences as well as learning in a classroom setting.  The course is designed as a two semester offering of independent research credit, beginning in the fall semester. Students preparing for graduate school or professional careers can expect intensive mentoring with faculty, staff and graduate students. Spring 2016 will feature 1 hours per week in the classroom and 4-6 hours per week of experiential learning in community research settings. Students will earn 3 credits.  Conversational Spanish is preferred; Spanish fluency is not required. For registration approval for FSHN 499, contact Dr. Margarita Teran-Garcia; teranmd@illinois.edu; for HDFS 494, contact Dr. Angela Wiley, awiley@illinois.edu.",
