This course will trace the idea of the everyday through recent histories of art, literature and film -- from it?s emergence as a subject in modernity to conceptual and discursive art practices of the 1960s, emphasizing its potential for gathering knowledge as well as exposing and reordering traditional hierarchies of power. Functioning as both a studio and a seminar, this course will incorporate readings and weekly films along with studio exercises and semester long projects -- to identify and revitalize the everyday within the context of studio based research and practice.",
