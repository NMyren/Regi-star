    "sectionText": "Topic Section T: Black Aesthetics in the Long 19th Century This course will examine the development of a self-conscious black aesthetic and literary criticism over the course of the long 19C century, beginning with Phillis Wheatley?s Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects (1793) and ending with W.E.B. Du Bois?s Souls of Black Folk (1903).  We will give special attention to form and genre, particularly serialized fiction and poetry, in a way that challenges the slave narrative-to-novel trajectory that dominated twentieth-century criticism and challenges us to theorize a black literary culture that emerged well before the ?Harlem Renaissance? of the twentieth century. We?ll think how an expanding archive and a different relation to that archive has and will continue to change the way we construct African American Literary histories (plural). We will also question the relationship between black artists and Western aesthetics, a tradition that was often overtly hostile to black expressive culture.  In that sense, we will simultaneously probe early black aesthetic discourse and situate it within and against aesthetic discourse(s) more broadly. Artists up for consideration include: Frederick Douglass, Frances E. W. Harper, Harriet Wilson, Pauline Hopkins, and others.",
