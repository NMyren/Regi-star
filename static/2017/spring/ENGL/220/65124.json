It is designed to introduce students from a variety of majors and backgrounds to the interdisciplinary, or cross-disciplinary, field of Literature and Science.  Please note: no formal training in the sciences is required.  We will read a variety of texts?including a healthy dose of science fiction?that can be ground under three broad, and broadly related, areas: the environmental humanities; media studies and digital humanities; and alternative visions of human beings and human society.  Readings for the course will include science-fiction novels by H. G. Wells, Octavia Butler, Kim Stanley Robinson, Richard Powers, and Margaret Atwood, and articles by contemporary writers and critics, including Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Stacy Alaimo, Katherine Hayles, Richard Lewontin).  And we will watch some classic science-fiction films and a few episodes of television series.  Course requirements: regular attendance and participation, three 3-5 page papers, a midterm, and a final.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
