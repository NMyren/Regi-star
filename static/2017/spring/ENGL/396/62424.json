In A Lover?s Discourse: Fragments, literary theorist and philosopher Roland Barthes reflects on love?lost, unrequited, imagined, and painfully and beautifully real. He offers us a language for discussing the complicated politics of intimacy. As he explains: ?to try to write love is the muck of language: that region of hysteria where language is both too much and too little,? and yet he succeeds in making us ask: What is love? How does it work? What?s love got to do with it all? In order to critically consider the philosophical, physical, and aesthetic manifestations of love, we will use Barthes?s book as a starting post; we will then turn to texts ranging from Plato?s Symposium to Beyoncï¿½?s Lemonade, exploring love letters between writers, artists and philosophers like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera to Rilke and his young poet, and performance sites including visual art, popular music, dance, and drama to analyze different ways of seeking and giving affection. We will also examine what it entails to love another or ?an other? across difference, turning to how race, gender, and sexuality wonderfully complicate a lover?s expression.","sectionTitle":"Lit, Theory & Performance","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
