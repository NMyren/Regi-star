By looking at the expressive tactics deployed in an array of contemporary movements coming from both the political left and the right (e.g., #BlackLivesMatter, Second Amendment rights advocacy, environmentalism, grazing rights, Occupy Wall Street, the debate over restroom use by transgender people, and more), we will explore instances of high-stakes rhetorical action that involve social media (slacktivism?), physical occupation, gestural expression, performance, spoken and written discourse, and direct action. Students will explore contemporary protest rhetoric through various primary documents (video, images, audio recordings), journalistic accounts, academic research, and theories of communication and rhetoric. Historical work will also be encouraged. Students from departments across campus are invited to enroll and bring varied research interests and methodologies into the class.","sectionTitle":"Protest Rhetorics","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
