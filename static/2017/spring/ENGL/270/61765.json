It was only in the 1840s, however, that crime became bracketed to mass entertainment. In this course we will look at crime from two perspectives. The first group of films focuses on agents of disorder, professional and nonprofessional criminals alike; the second group on detectives and police, agents of law and order. Through these opposing lenses, we will analyze fictional representations of crime from a range of perspectives: character studies, motivations, victims, detection methods, representations of the police, social impact of crime, class, gender, race, censorship, and spectator address. Evaluated work will include three medium-length papers and several shorter ones, as well as active participation in class discussion. While experience in film studies is a plus, it is not required for enrollment in this course.","sectionTitle":"Crime Films","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
