The seminar will focus on lesson planning, creating audio-visual toolkits, moderating discussions, crafting assignments, and other pedagogical issues. We will therefore focus on four principle undertakings: 1) drawing up lesson plans around a textbook and learning to augment them with information from other sources; 2) making persuasive audio-visual material that illuminate the technical and critical aspects of cinema; 3) sharpening a teaching philosophy that informs the whole pedagogic project and clarifies why a study of cinema is important in our media driven age; and 4) practical matters like effective syllabi and assignments. By the end of the semester, participants will have a portfolio of key documents and digital material that will be of practical use in the teaching of film and in the presentation of a competitive teaching profile in the academic job market.","sectionTitle":"The Teaching of Film","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
