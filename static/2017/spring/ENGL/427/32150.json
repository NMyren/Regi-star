We will focus this semester on three interlocking developments that complicate our understanding of the Enlightenment: 1) the growth of what we might now call an ecological understanding of the natural world; 2) colonialism and the slave trade devoted to securing overseas the resources that Britain did not have or could not produce; and 3) and the increasingly active role that literature played as a forum for exploring changing notions of authority, liberty, and gender identity.  We will read texts by important writers active in the second half of the eighteenth century, including novels by Jane Austen, Anne Radcliffe, and Charlotte Smith; the autobiography of Oladuah Equiano; poetry by William Blake; Anna Barbauld, Anne Yearsley, Oliver Goldsmith; and nonfiction by Mary Wollstonecraft, Adam Smith, and others.  Course requirements: regular attendance and participation, two essays, a midterm, and a final exam.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
