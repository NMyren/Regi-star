    "sectionText": "Teaching writing is always labor intensive, often challenging, and occasionally terrifying. In this course, we will explore a core set of questions that inform the teaching of writing in our schools: Why teach writing? What is academic writing good for? Is there such a thing as good writing? Do effective writers gain any power in contemporary society? This course is designed with future language arts teachers in mind, so you'll leave the class ready to do such things as: design compelling assignments that challenge your students, respond effectively to student writing, create thoughtful group writing assignments, support various forms of multimodal writing, and work with writers who challenge what you know and how you think. Students who take this class should be prepared to question how you were taught to write in high school. Students should also be prepared to write in new ways.",
