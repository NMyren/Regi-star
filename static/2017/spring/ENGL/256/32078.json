Focusing on the business of print, and the role of literature in the lived experience of everyday life throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, we will cover the major literary and intellectual currents of the period, including the rise of industrialization and imperialism, the shifting relationship between the country and the city, and the role of racial, ethnic, and sexual difference in reshaping how Americans understood the nation, the region, and the always elusive ideal of ?community.?  \tThis class will use The Norton Anthology of American Literature.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
