We will study both the texts, then, and disability studies critiques of these texts. Formal and informal writing about course texts will be required in abundance.  It is strongly recommended that all English and Teaching of English majors take ENGL 300 and ENGL 301 BEFORE taking any other 300- or 400-level courses.","sectionTitle":"Disability in Literataure","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
