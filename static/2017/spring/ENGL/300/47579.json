The first layers of strangeness in this course concern love within marriage of the British Victorian period (1837-1901)?a time of intense debate over the injustice of many laws especially those affecting women. Not surprisingly, with the reform of marriage laws, love and marriage became prime topics of public conversation with many myths and narratives circulating about ideal male and female lovers. Studying these will lead us into ever stranger textures of love: some voices like those of Dante Gabriel Rossetti?s and Elizabeth Barrett Browning?s sonnet singers may be only mildly strange for they prefigure models we recognize today, but others may be more troubling even to those of us who think of ourselves as ?progressive.?  By virtue of the imaginative and challenging ethical questions they pose, strange Victorian love poems make inviting material for exercises in writing about literature. Examining such instances as the Sapphic love of Michael Field, the deadly obsessives in Robert Browning's ?Porphyria's Lover? or ?My Last Duchess,? or the alienating passion of necrophiliacs and sado-masochists in Algernon Charles Swinburne's ?The Leper? and ?Anactoria,? we will undertake a variety of writing exercises: for instance, unpacking a poetic metaphor, shaping a prï¿½cis of a critical argument, integrating secondary material into literary discussions, as well as researching and documenting a substantial critical paper. We will aim to produce approximately 25 pages of graded writing in the course of the semester. [Textbook warning: We will use Victorian Literature 1830-1900 edited by Dorothy Mermin and Herbert F. Tucker.  Buy early and your book should cost less than $10. Buy late and it will get very expensive.]  It is strongly recommended that all English and Teaching of English majors take ENGL 300 and ENGL 301 BEFORE taking any other 300- or 400-level courses.","sectionTitle":"Strange Victorian Love Poetry","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
