Science fiction author Judith Merrill claimed the role of science fiction is ?to explore, to discover [or] to learn? something about the nature of ?reality?; at the heart of this course, then, are also philosophical, historical, and ethical questions crucial to the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. What, for example, is the relationship between works of imagination and technological innovation? Between technological innovation and the relationships among humans, non-human animals, and machines? In the 21st Century, what does it mean to be ?human,? and how does the category of gender relate to that of species, or biological kind? Drawing on representative science fiction texts, supplemented by video, film, and critical articles, we will discuss these and related issues.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
