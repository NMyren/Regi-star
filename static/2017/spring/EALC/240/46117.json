    "sectionText": "Chinese Civilization, 3 hours.  This course is a general survey of major aspects of Chinese civilization.  Readings will be organized, not in a chronological order as in a history course, but under thematic headings such as geography and historical heritage; essentials of daily life; Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist thoughts; popular belief and culture; elite literary expression; elite artistic expression; and Chinese and Western views of China.  For each of these topics, we will read an introductory article and selections of important Chinese writings in translation.  To provide an integrated and balanced view of Chinese civilization, we will make excursions into problems of painting, calligraphy, architecture, gardening, mass entertainment and other aspects of material culture.",
