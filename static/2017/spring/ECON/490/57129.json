After introducing the basic concepts of poverty and inequality, between as well as within countries, this course focuses on the role that migration and population growth play in the process of economic development. The causes of migration and its consequences are examined at national and international levels together with their policy implications, including those related to urbanization, brain drain, and labor market impacts of immigration.
