    "sectionText": "This section is restricted to undergraduate students. This section is restricted to Economics students until the morning of January 9th. This class deals with the inter-relationships between economic development and migration. After introducing the basic concepts of poverty and inequality, between as well as within countries, this course focuses on the role that migration and population growth play in the process of economic development. The causes of migration and its consequences are examined at national and international levels together with their policy implications, including those related to urbanization, brain drain, and labor market impacts of immigration. A range of migration forms is discussed, including international and internal migration, permanent and temporary migration, legal and illegal migration, as well as forced migration and refugees.",
