An exploration of the horror film and its relation to society, this course considers the social, cultural, historical, and political context of the horror film and the ways in which we can understand them as cultural products which absorb and reflect collective social memories, traumas, and fears.  The course will cover both U.S. and international horror films, including discussions of topics such as war, terrorism, social and political movements, sex and gender, race, the commodification of fear, and medical pandemics.  In doing so we will consider how the filmic negotiations around these phenomena intersect not only within the films thems\\elves, but also within film as an industrial art form, including marketing, advertising, and reception.",
