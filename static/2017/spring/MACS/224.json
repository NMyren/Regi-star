We'll use four primary focal points (ESPN, Sport Fandom, Action-Sports, Data Production / Smart Stadiums) to help us understand today's sportsmedia cultural industry's challenges and possibilities, and the kinds of challenges and possibilities that the sportsmedia cultural industry creates for society. We'll also use our course focal points and related industry websites to concretize the key concepts (drawn from theoretical readings and applied studies in media studies, sociology, sport studies, and technology studies).",
