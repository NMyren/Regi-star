The course centers on the early 20th Century (Lydia Mendoza, Leonor Villegas de Magnon) as well at the more classical Chicana/Chicano Civil Rights Movement (Joan Baez, Dolores Huerta), and the new crop of memoir and autobiograpy, as represented in the most recent texts by well-established Chicana writers, such as Sandra Cisneros, Gloria Anzaldua and Ana Castillo. We will also discuss the professionalization of the field of Latina/Latino Studies in the work of Tey Diana Rebolledo. Additionally, students will study the writing of self with a focus on gender, sexuality, and genre. Historical periods to be covered include the Mexican Revolution, the Civil Rights Movement, and 9/11.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
