    "sectionText": "Topic: Creative Writing for Marginalized People. Meets with AAS 299 and CW 202. This course is a creative writing workshop designed particularly for writers of color, but also inclusive of writers from other marginalized and oppressed groups. Students will turn in either narrative fiction or creative non-fiction stories to be critiqued by their peers. The workshop will be a safe space in which writers can explore and develop their craft in an atmosphere of support and understanding, where writers can get feedback from each other, and where writers can be empowered to continue to write about the stories they feel are important and necessary. In this class we will examine the relationship between form and content, stories and politics. In addition to sharing your own creative pieces with each other, you will also read and discuss stories by published writers.",
