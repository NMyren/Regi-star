Designed from a research-driven perspective, GEOG 479 will leverage CyberGIS architecture to facilitate spatial thinking and knowledge discovery from geospatial Big Data. The specific topics included in this course are tailored to cover geospatial Big Data processing, analysis, and visualizations. In particular, students will have chances to play with geospatial Big Data in various forms (e.g., geo-located Twitter data, Taxi trajectory data and national DEM, etc.); and learn to solve geospatial problems with high-performance computing environments (e.g., Apache Hadoop and Spark) and data visual-analytic toolkits (parallel MapAlgebra, Python, D3.js, etc.) This course also provides carefully crafted materials for hands-on training by accessing the computing environment setup in the world's first GIS supercomputer, ROGER (Resourcing Open Geo-spatial Education and Research) named after Roger Tomlinson (Father of GIS).","sectionTitle":"CyberGIS","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
