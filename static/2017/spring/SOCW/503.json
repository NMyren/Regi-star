    "description": "This course uses a case study and inquiry based approach to foster student learning of the core concepts of trauma (theory and foundational knowledge) and evidence-based practice interventions effective in treating children, youth, and families that experience trauma. Cases discussed include children, youth, and families exposed to traumatic events (i.e. abuse, neglect, domestic violence, community violence and natural disasters). Strength-based practice interventions that build on existing child and family strengths that enhance growth and resiliency after trauma are studied. Prerequisite: SOCW 400.",
