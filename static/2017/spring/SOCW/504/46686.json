This section will be randomized to one of two teaching conditions to allow us to test whether one teaching method is better than the other at improving students? skills to use an evidence-based treatment model called Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT).  Upon registration and also during the first week of class, the study will be explained to you and you will have an opportunity to consent to whether or not you want your data used in a research study.  Eventually, you will also be allowed access to all teaching modules if you do not initially receive them during the study period. Because content in these classes is funded in part by SAMHSA, we will ask all students to complete training satisfaction surveys whether or not they decide to participate in the study.  If you have any questions about the study before you register that is taking place in this class, please contact Kyle Bennet (kmbennet@illinois.edu).","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
