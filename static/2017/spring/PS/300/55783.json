This course relies on both theoretical and empirical literature to examine a host of questions about terrorism in an advanced, intensive, discussion-based seminar. In particular, we investigate the definition(s) of terrorism, its historical use and evolution, the motivations of various types of groups that employ or have employed this tactic, different forms of terrorism, variation in state responses to terrorism (or, where and when terrorism successfully results in concessions), and the effectiveness of a range of counterterrorism strategies and tactics. Not intended for students with freshman standing. Students may receive only three credit hours for PS 300. Restricted to Political Science majors through November 14, 2016.","sectionTitle":"Terrorism","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
