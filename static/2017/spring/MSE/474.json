Part (1) fundamental biopolymer synthesis: functional group protection and de-protection; bioconjugation; protein pegylation and design and synthesis of natural and synthetic non-degradable and degradable polymers, hydrogels, bio-inspired materials, and stimuli responsive biomaterials. Part (2) preparation of nanomedicines for drug and gene delivery: nanofabritation of micelles, nanoparticles, protein conjugates, drug conjugates, nanoencapsulates, and polymeric vesicles; in-vitro and in-vivo small-molecule, gene, and protein delivery. Impact of the chemical structures of biopolymers on the stability, biocompatibility, toxicity, and in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy; clinical translation of the resulting nanomedicines in drug delivery. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours.
