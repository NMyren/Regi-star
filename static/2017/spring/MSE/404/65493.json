Hands-on experience with popular macroscopic computational materials science and engineering software through project-based learning in molecular simulation (LAMMPS) and discrete dislocation dynamics (ParaDiS). Students will also develop proficiency in data analysis and visualization in MATLAB. The course will prioritize the physical principles underlying the software to confer an understanding of their applicability and limitations, and hands-on immersive praxis to give students the confidence and expertise to independently use these tools.","sectionTitle":"Modeling Plasticity","startDate":"2017-03-13-05:00","statusCode":"A"}
