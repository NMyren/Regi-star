    "sectionText": "This course will explore how to create a more culturally responsive and sustainable model of  engineering outreach with under-represented students. Lectures and discussions will cover topics from the history of discrimination in the US education system to current best practices in teaching and outreach at the K-12 level. Guest speakers from across the University will enrich our discussions. In the laboratory portion of this course, you will work with a group of middle school students and a local community organization to solve an engineering problem that is relevant to the middle schoolers? interests and expertise. The project will result in solutions developed collaboratively through iterative prototyping using a wide range of tools available through the University and the school and discussions with the community partner. Please note that every student must sign up for a 1.5 hour teaching practicum on Fridays and that that this course will not count toward the minimum 12-hour MechSE 500-level coursework requirement for MechSE graduate students.  This class does not count toward the 500-level in major coursework requirement for MechSE students.  Students from other departments should inquire with their department to determine if this course can be used towards their MS or Ph.D.",
