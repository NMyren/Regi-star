Critical intersections of bias, exclusion, and marginalization will be explored through a variety of case studies. Implications for how we construct search and discovery systems (e.g databases, finding aids, taxonomies and catalogues), and other tools, are crucial considerations for those engaging in cultural heritage work. Open to masters and doctoral students. Restricted to graduate students in the School of Information Sciences. All other students need department approval. Email ischool-advising@illinois.edu.",
