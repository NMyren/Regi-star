Built around several video dialogues with prominent feminists, the course utilizes an international network of institutions and scholars called FemTechNet. Student projects will be situated within local, interdisciplinary, and cross-institutional conversations. Through reading, discussion, writing, and making, we will add to a growing and global database of materials relating feminist technologies to economies, identities, infrastructures, and movements.
