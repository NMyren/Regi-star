{"creditHours":"3 hours.","description":"A study of social problems in the United States necessarily entails a discussion of global issues. To that end, this course will examine many contemporary social issues such as crime, war and terrorism, the environment, inequality, poverty, discrimination, the economic recession, and others, through a global framework. Many of the topics we will cover could motivate an entire semester's study in their own right; indeed, some scholars devote their entire careers to but one of these topics. However, this breadth allows us to think broadly about the issues that are identified as social problems and the ways in which individuals and groups attempt to resolve those problems; both processes are revealing about the time and society in which we live. One of the main objectives of this class is to learn about how sociologists examine social problems through analysis and research. Alongside that process, you will improve your critical thinking skills and become a better/more informed consumer of information.","href":"/2017/spring/SOC/163.json","id":"SOC 163","label":"Social Problems","parents":{"calendarYear":{"href":"/2017.json","id":"2017","label":"2017"},"subject":{"href":"/2017/spring/SOC.json","id":"SOC","label":"Sociology"},"term":{"href":"/2017/spring.json","id":"120171","label":"Spring 2017"}},"sections":[{"href":"/2017/spring/SOC/163/65458.json","id":"65458","label":"TVH"}]}
