    "description": "This course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to study both historical and contemporary perspectives on leadership and policy in diverse contexts and to prompt reflection on their own practice. As students read, discuss, reflect on, and critique a variety of perspectives and topics such as race, class, power, cultural leadership, policy, change, diversity, and building community, they will consider how the literature informs the development of a personal philosophy of education leadership, takes into consideration moral and ethical issues, the implementation of educational policy, the purposes and nature of the task, and the complexity and diversity of educational contexts.",
