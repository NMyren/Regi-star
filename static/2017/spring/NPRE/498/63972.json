The intermittence of renewable systems mandates the development of efficient energy stoarge and backups as well as conveyance systems for their effective implementation.  Exhaustive coverage of energy storage technologies including:  battery technologies encompassing primary and secondary electrochemical cells; lead acid, nickel-based, Li-ion batteries; advanced battery systems including redox/flow batteries, sulfur-sodium; hydrogen electrochemical cells and regenerative fuel cells including hydride storages; mechanical energy storage including flywheel, compressed-air and pumped hydraulic storage; thermal and chemical storage based on phase-change and medium enthalphy-change reversible chemical reactions; and inductive stoage in super capacitors and magnetic using superconducting magnets are covered.  Social and economic aspects of storage technology and specific new development in stoarge technology are covered.","sectionTitle":"Energy Storage & Conveyance","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
