Survey of multidisciplinary issues of risk, safety, and reliability of complex systems.  State-of-the-art techniques in Probabilistic Risk Assessment, which provides input for risk-informed decision-making for design, operation, and regulatory oversight in a variety of fields including nuclear power plants, aviation, space, chemical processes, oil and gas industry, and healthcare.  Topics:  Probability and statistics for risk analysis; Systems scenario modeling; Treatment of failure dependencies; Uncertainty propagation; Probabilistic physics of failure; Human reliability, Failure causal modeling, and Data analytics.  Software codes for risk analysis, uncertainty treatment, and Bayesian analysis will be introduced for assignment. Prerequisites:  Junior, senior, or graduate standing in any engineering discipline.","sectionTitle":"Probabilistic Risk Assessment","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
