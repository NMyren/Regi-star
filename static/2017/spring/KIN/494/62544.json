Neuromechanics: This course focuses on interaction of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems during human and animal movement with a fcous on basic biological and engineering principles.  Topics will include neuromechanical control of movement, neurorehabilitation, biorobotics, and computer simulations of neuromechanical systems.  For one class week (Wednesdays), the instructor will present background material on topics each week in a lecture/open discussion format.  For the second class each week (Mondays), the class will conduct a hands-on laboratory using and building computer simulations of neuromechanical systems.","sectionTitle":"Special Topics - Neuromechanic","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
