    "sectionText": "Kant?s Ethical Theory   This seminar will examine Kant?s ethical theory and the moral psychology that serves as its foundation. Kant holds that morality is distinguished by a special type of motivation that can only be the exercise of  ?pure? practical reason.  We will consider just what such reason is supposed to be, and how it is related to the autonomy and freedom of the will.  We will also consider how such moral reason and the special feeling of respect relate to the rest of our emotional economy, with particular attention to Kant?s understanding of self-love, virtue, ?rational faith?, and the ?radical evil? in human nature.",
