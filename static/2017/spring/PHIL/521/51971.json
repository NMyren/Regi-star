The landscape of ontology is changing. Under the Quinean conception, ontology is primarily concerned with what exists. But many are beginning to think otherwise. The key questions of ontology are not, they say, existence questions (which are often times easily answered) but grounding questions. In this class, we will examine the nature and import of grounding and other related notions (such as fundamentality, ontological dependence, and truthmaking). What is grounding? What are its relata? What principles are true of it (it is irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive)? How does grounding relate to modality? We will also look at some disputes over what grounds what. In particular, we will look into the dispute over fundamental mereology (are wholes grounded in their parts or is it the other way around). Questions concerning fundamentality will also be investigated. What things are fundamental? Is there a fundamental level or is it instead turtles all the way down?","sectionTitle":"Grounding Seminar","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
