    "sectionText": "Undergraduate Section  We shall discuss some basic issues in the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  The basic philosophical issues concern the nature of mathematical truth and the possibility and conditions of mathematical knowledge.  Among the questions to be considered are the following: are the theorems of pure mathematics objectively true or false, independently of the mental? If so, what makes them true or false? In particular, are there specifically ?mathematical? objects and, if so, how can we know about them? Are there properly basic concepts in mathematics ? concepts from which all other mathematical notions can somehow be derived ? and, if so, what are they? In particular, does a theory unfolding the concept of a set or class provide   a satisfactory foundation for mathematics? Are there limits to our mathematical knowledge?  Finally, we will join an ongoing discussion sparked by the logician Kurt G\ufffddel, who famously claimed ?Either mathematics is too big for the human mind, or the human mind is more than a machine.?",
