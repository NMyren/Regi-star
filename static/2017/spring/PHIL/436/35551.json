Some political philosophers approach this question by asking what would permit us to move from a condition without political institutions, a ?state of nature,? to life in political society. In this course we?ll explore four classic state of nature theories?those of Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and Nozick?and their different answers to a question we ask too rarely: why not anarchy?","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
