    "sectionText": "This course explores how the conflict is depicted in Israeli and Palestinian films from the British Mandate to the present. We will look at how social and historical processes shape Palenstinian and Israeli cinematic narratives. We will also discuss issues of self-representation, the representation of the Other, the relationship to the land, diaspora, and narratives of nation-building. This course offers a cinematic journey from the revolutionary to the postmodern, from the collective to the individual, from hope to despair.",
