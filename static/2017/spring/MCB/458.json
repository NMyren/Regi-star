    "description": "Introduction to the basic mechanisms of human disease with a focus on the building blocks of pathological processes at the sub-organismal and organismal level. Basic biological processes will be stressed including tissue adaptation, injury, inflammation, repair and neoplasia. Pathology synthesizes cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry and immunology holistically so as to understand the body's limited responses to the cornucopia of experienced physiological insults. 3 undergraduate hours. No graduate credit. Prerequisite: MCB 354 or equivalent, or consent of instructor. For MCB and Biochemistry undergraduate majors only.",
