They are intimately involved in the lives of all major life forms on earth, and impose enormous public health and economic burdens upon human society.  This course will focus on the common fundamental concepts that underlie and connect the replication, pathogenesis, and evolution of diverse virus families, rather than serve as a detail-focused survey of viruses.  Group discussion of primary literature will be used to illustrate experimental approaches for exploring fundamental questions in virology.  Prerequisites for this section of MCB 493 are MCB 250, 252, 300 and 354.  This section of MCB 493 counts as advanced MCB course credit.","sectionTitle":"Viral Pathogenesis & Evolution","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
