Restricted to Public Health (MPH) majors.  This course is designed to teach you basic information about cultural competence as applied in public health spheres in the United States and globally. The course is also designed to teach you how to make decisions for culturally competent public health services given competing policies for patients, providers and health organizations.  To narrow the topics down, this semester we are going to try to think differently about cultural competence whether for patients, providers or health care systems. After briefly reviewing basic information about the definition and dimensions of cultural competence, we will learn basic information about a wide range of programs and policies that are currently in place to address cultural competence at the level of the patients, providers, and health systems.","sectionTitle":"Special Topics: Cultural Comp","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
