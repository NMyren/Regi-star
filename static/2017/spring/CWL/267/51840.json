Along the way, we will consider the role of historical and cultural context in shaping our interpretations of these literary texts, and we will put into practice some key terms drawn from narratology and various schools of critical theory. Requirements: regular attendance and participation, informal responses, three essays, and a final exam","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
