    "sectionText": "Field Geology: Structure and tectonics of the southwestern United States. The course consists of a required ~8-day field trip to western Arizona and southern California during Spring Break, and a series of pre-trip lectures addressing the regional tectonic evolution of the North American Cordillera. Field study may focus on the Basin and Range Rift, the San Andreas Fault, and Death Valley. Participants will be camping in isolated desert locations, with no facilities, during the trip. Class meeting schedule: Tuesday (5:00 - 6:30 p.m.) Cost to students is estimated to be $750. The course is intended primarily for upper level geology majors and graduate students. Prerequisites: At least one 400-level geology course; permission of the instructor, based on an application process, for there is limited space. Priority will be given to students with a strong record of coursework in geoscience and/or a particular need for taking the course in.  4 hrs.",
