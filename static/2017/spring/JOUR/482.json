    "description": "The interview methodology students learn is seen as the best way to provide the ethnographer/writer/reporter with insight into social phenomena. The methodology can be used to examine living conditions, family history and attitudes of ethnic groups at any class level -- wealthy, affluent, middle class, poor or underclass. Students with insatiable curiosity about behavior will be able to extract from participants surprising revelations about their needs, desires and motivations. Students will learn how personalities, circumstances, and choices made by participants' parents and forebears affect the participant's life today. Same as AFRO 482. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: Juniors, Seniors and Graduate students of any discipline.",
