    "description": "Soren Kierkegaard is an early author who wrestled with the concept of the individual self and championed subjective experience as a counterbalance to objective rationalism. Students in this seminar-style course will gain extensive familiarity with Kierkegaard's major works, as well as how they relate to two currents in 19th century society, existentialism and pietism. These works will be evaluated within their particular Nordic literary context, through critical analysis of related novels, plays and films by Andersen, Ibsen, Bremer, Strindberg, Lagerlof, Blixen, and Bergman (readings in English translation). Same as CWL 472, PHIL 472, and RLST 472. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.",
