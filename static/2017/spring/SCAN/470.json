    "description": "Investigate conceptions of the Nordic and West-European welfare state from the early twentieth-century to today from critical interpretive, historical, and cultural studies perspectives. Building on close analysis of influential works in literature, film, arts, and architecture from primarily Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the course will address historical factors and characteristics of the socio-cultural imaginary surrounding the rise and, some argue, subsequent dismantling of the Nordic welfare state. Same as CWL 470 and EURO 470. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: At least one course in literature, film, or the arts; or consent of the instructor.",
