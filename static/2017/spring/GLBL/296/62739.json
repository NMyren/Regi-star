    "sectionText": "Recently the extent of mass incarceration in the US has gained much attention. Less widely understood are the ways in which an expanded criminalization of the poor at a global level has greatly increased the regimes of punishment of marginalized populations and shifted enormous resources from social welfare to corrections and security. This course will examine the changes in criminal justice systems at a global level, looking at trends like changing immigration laws, the rise of supermax prisons, prisons for profit and the adaptation of US style mandatory minimums in societies as diverse as Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa.",
