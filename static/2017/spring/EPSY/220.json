    "description": "Various behavioral science theories will be covered (e.g., person-environment interaction, decision-making, group dynamics, stereotype threat, personality traits). Discussions of research findings to applied career practices will also be included. Students will develop a working-knowledge of these theories through interactive lectures, guided class discussions, case-based readings, and group activities that require them to think critically and flexibly about theory in order to generate solutions for real-world problems. Additional fees may apply. See Class Schedule. On request, students will be required to participate in a total of 6 hours of experiments outside of class.",
