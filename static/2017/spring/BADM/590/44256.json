When crossing borders entrepreneurs have to face new challenges created by different political, cultural, and economic environments. Under these circumstances, success depends on the companies' abilities to adapt themselves to the new realities, or their capability to transform the local economy to their needs. This adaptation demands flexibility in the companies' managerial organization, creativity at dealing with different legal cultures, and strong emphasis on technological innovation. By studying several cases in different historical moments, this course will explore how the adaptation of different companies to diverse and sometimes hostile environments permitted the creation of the global economy as we know it.",
