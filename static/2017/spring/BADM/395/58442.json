Since this is a hands-on class, there are no exams and few lectures. Instead, students will engage in experiential learning, trial and error, and sharing their ideas with others. Each student will be part of a three-person interdisciplinary team (business, design, and engineering). Each team will conceptualize, design, prototype, make, and market a new thing. To do well in this class, you will need to be creative, have an open mind, be comfortable with uncertainty and work well with others.",
