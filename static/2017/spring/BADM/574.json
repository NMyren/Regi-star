    "description": "This course provides quantitative tools for solution of management problems involving risk, competing objectives, and complex constraints. The course will provide hands-on experience with techniques for solving these problems, with a particular emphasis on models and methods that enable managers to proactively manage and mitigate risk, obtain insight, and support decision making. Models are illustrated with applications to operations management, finance, and marketing, with a particular emphasis on issues associated with project portfolio management.  Hands-on modeling skills are developed using spreadsheet-based software tools. We will consider challenges that executives and organizations encounter when implementing these approaches, and demonstrate how mathematical models can improve on \"seat of the pants\" methods.",
