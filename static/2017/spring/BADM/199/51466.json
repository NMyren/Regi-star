More importantly, great leaders know that failure more often than not is a self-inflicted wound whether it is an individual or an organization. These leaders can identify the stages of failure and are equipped with the necessary competencies and drive to pull themselves or their organizations out of the downward spiral righting the ship along the way. Such leadership should be grounded in the foundational principles of vision, strategy, and execution.",
