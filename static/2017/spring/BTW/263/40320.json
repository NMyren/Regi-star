The overarching goal of this online-only course is improving your ability to create effective texts throughout your career, and achieving that goal is likely to involve some adjustments to your mental models of what writing[verb] is, who is involved, where (they are involved in a writing[verb] process), why (they are involved), how (they are involved), and the likely ramifications (of their involvement).  Genres will include memo, business letter, case study, proposal, schedule of deliverables, and training documents (e.g., instructions and procedures).  There will be no regular class meetings, but there will be online office hours on weekends (and perhaps select weekday evenings).  The course work is not self paced; assignment due dates will be prescribed by the instructor.",
