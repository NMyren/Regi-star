    "description": "Several clinics offer practical legal education through a variety of in-house clinics. The clinics focus on specific lawyering skills that are relevant to a particular area of practice (e.g., litigation or family advocacy), and have a classroom component. Students engage in legal work under the supervision of experienced attorneys; the work may include conducting client interviews, doing legal research and fact investigation, preparing legal documents, negotiating, and in some cases, engaging in real trials. No graduate credit. 1 to 4 professional hours. May be repeated up to 22 hours. Approved for both letter and S/U grading.",
