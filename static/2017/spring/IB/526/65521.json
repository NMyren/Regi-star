Use of plant chemicals as repellents against fleas, lice, mosquitoes, biting flies, bed bugs, ticks and other bloodsucking parasites well as pesticides to kill life stages off the host will be reviewed. Students will evaluate ethnobotanical, naturopathic , and homeopathic uses in the context of controlled studies in the scientific literature. Theoretical underpinnings of and ethical concerns about bioprospecting for new therapeutic agents will also be discussed.  WILL MEET IN 407 MORRILL HALL.",
