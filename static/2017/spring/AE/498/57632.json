Project based course centered on the aerodynamics, stability/control, propulsion, and manufacturing methods for unmanned aerial vehicles. This course will cover the basic background necessary to design and build small UAVs concentrating on fixed wing aircraft, but also incorporating aspects of flapping flight and rotorcraft. Emphasis will be placed on the design, construction, and instrumentation of an objective specific vehicle, as well as, analyzing the performance using a combination of theoretical analysis, computational tools, and testing. Course for undergraduates only.  Prerequisites:  MSE 280, AE 311, AE 321, or permission of the instructor","sectionTitle":"Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
