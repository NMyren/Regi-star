It will appeal to students with interests in the history, art history, and archaeology of the Classical and Hellenistic Greek, Byzantine and Ottoman periods, as well as to those with a focus on the geopolitics of the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. The course discusses issues such as the birth and development of ancient Greek Democracy and its present legacy, the rise of the ancient Hellenic world, the rise and fall of regional and global empires in the region ? the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Arab Empires as well as the extension of the British Empire in the region ? the birth of modern nation-states in the region during the 19th and 20th century and finally the region?s integration into the mainland Europe and the European Union in the 20th and 21st centuries.
