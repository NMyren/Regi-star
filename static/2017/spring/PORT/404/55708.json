    "sectionText": "\"The Telenovela\" is the title of this special topics course.  Telenovelas are prime-time television serial melodramas broadcast six days a week for up to ten months. Frequently compared to soap operas in North America, telenovelas (called novelas) possess a striking cultural and political valence in Brazil and have been exported around the world. Using insights from anthropology, communications, and cultural studies, this course explores how telenovelas reflect and shape class, gender, modernity, nation, race, sexuality, among other dynamics. The key point is to grasp how these power relations are constructed in the telenovela and the ways that telenovela viewers reproduce, endure, and/or circumvent them. Our examination of the authorial production and audience reception of these media flows will culminate in a final project that require students to watch one of two series (subtitled in English) available at the university library and use the key approaches in this course to write a critique.
