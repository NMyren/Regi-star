The course explores this institution through the lens of the unique \"rotating presidency\" of the Council, providing students with a quick-changing frame of reference that ensures contemporary and topical discussions. This semester the course will be focusing primarily on the Presidencies of Slovakia, Malta, and Estonia. After discussing the theoretical and structural framework of the Council of the European Union, the course critically analyzes presidencies from the past and present with a special emphasis on how different leaders and environments impact the behavior of the institution.  The class will conclude with a capstone project involving an institutional simulation of a key European Union institution. This simulation will allow students to experience how the institution functions in practice.  No prerequisites, repeatable only for different country presidencies.","sectionTitle":"Council of the European Union","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
