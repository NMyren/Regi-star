It historicizes and contextualizes conceptions of national identity in different Latin American countries using a variety of primary materials from political speeches, pamphlets, literature, visual arts, music, and film.  Students will gain a close-up view of the shifting, contested, and political nature of national identity discourses from multiple perspectives.  In-class lectures and secondary source readings will provide the necessary historical background to situate discussions of the primary materials (textual and otherwise).  Particular attention will be paid to national discourses that emerged during moments of conflict such as the wars of independence, Argentina\"s conquista del desierto, the Mexican and Cuban Revolutions, and the military coups of the 1960s and 70s.     Students must meet the prerequisite requirements for this course (found in the Catalog Entry) or will be told to drop on the first day of classes. Non-registered students are not allowed to sit in or audit.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
