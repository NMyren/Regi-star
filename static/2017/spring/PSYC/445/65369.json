In this class we will learn about neuroimaging, with particular emphasis on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a prominent Cognitive Neuroscience tool that allows ?scanning? the brain?s activity. The lectures introduce how to use an MRI scanner, the basic biophysics that makes functional imaging possible, experimental design for fMRI, and basic data analysis. During the labs students will get hands on experience analyzing fMRI data.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
