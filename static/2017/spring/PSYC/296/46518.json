Examples of topics include anxiety, depression, addiction, obesity, cognitive performance, and personality characteristics.  Special attention will be paid to race, sex, and socioeconomic differences and their influence on both genetic risk and environmental stress. The class will emphasize critical thinking and conceptualization and will frequently include open discussions.  The goal of the class is to critically evaluate the scientific bases of what are often emotionally-charged subjects, so that students are better informed and knowledgeable as they navigate their own life in a modern society..",
