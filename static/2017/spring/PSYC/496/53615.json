    "sectionText": "PSYC 496 ID3 is the first semester of the Social Justice Education Paraprofessional Program (SJEPP), a 3-semester course sequence designed to develop interpersonal facilitation skills and deepen an understanding of diversity and social justice issues. This course is designed to give students a foundation in the skills and knowledge needed to facilitate culturally diverse group interactions. The primary group facilitation method will be structured Intergroup Dialogue. Through the SJEPP courses, students will learn how to develop interactive learning programs in the form of workshops or classroom curriculum.  While in the program students will serve as peer educators for the campus community; either through an 8-week one credit dialogue course or by facilitating our 60-minute I-Journey workshops.  This program is open to all students and is a three semester commitment starting in Spring.
