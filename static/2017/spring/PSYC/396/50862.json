    "sectionText": "Senior priority enrollment begins November 2nd. Junior priority enrollment begins November 9th. Open enrollment begins at 10am on November 21st.  This course will examine major topics in the psychology of religion and spirituality to promote reflection on how religion shapes attitudes, behavior, and contemporary U.S. society.  Through the lens of psychology, questions will be explored such as: Why are some people religious and spiritual?  What are the diverse ways that people experience and express their religion and spirituality?  How do we study religion and spirituality from a psychological perspective?  What do religion and spirituality look like across the lifespan?  Does religion shape prejudice, morality, violence, or altruism?  What is the role of religion in promoting health?  How do religion and religious organizations shape society and social attitudes?  What does neuroscience reveal about religious and spiritual experiences?  Overall, we will examine these and other questions to promote greater understanding regarding the role of religion and spirituality in the lives of individuals and larger society. Prerequisite: PSYC 100 *Approved for Clinical/Community and General Psychology Concentration*",
