The purpose of this course is to deepen the accessibility awareness of participants by exposing them to a broad range of accessibility concerns when creating electronic materials. This will include an examination of how people with disabilities are impacted by different technologies. The course will expose students to the building blocks of the web HTML and CSS and provide an introduction to multimedia accessibility and document formats including MS Word, PDF, and PowerPoint. Students will also be invited to explore some of the more challenging areas of accessibility, like maps and emerging media-rich design trends. The course will close with a look at best practices for purchasing and vetting third-party vendors and give students the opportunity to apply techniques for conducting usability/accessibility testing for audiences with disablities.",
