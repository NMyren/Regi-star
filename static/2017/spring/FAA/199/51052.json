High art and street art, tradition and experimentation, the familiar and the unfamiliar, creativity in America and around the globe provide the foundation for this course that welcomes curious students from all disciplines on campus. Students will attend performances and exhibitions, meet and interact with artists, and examine core issues and values associated with diversity and the creative process in the context of our increasingly complex society and global human collective. Faculty teams from the arts, sciences, humanities, and other campus domains will lead students through a variety of visual arts, music, dance, and theatre experiences throughout the semester at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and the Krannert Art Museum -- two of the country's leading university-based cultural institutions -- to spark investigation and dialogue. [Admission to performances and exhibitions will be provided without charge to students enrolled in this course.]",
