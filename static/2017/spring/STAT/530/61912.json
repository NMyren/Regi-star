Introduction to statistical methods used in the analysis of genomic data. Methods are organized around data types commonly found in biological experiments, such as genotype data, gene expression levels, histone modifications, and microbiome data. Emphasis on statistical understanding. Practical implementation will be illustrated in R.  Prerequisites: STAT 410, STAT 420, thorough knowledge of R.  Priority registration is restricted to STAT/CHBE/ANSC/MCB Graduate Students. This restriction is expected to be removed sometime during the business day December 1, 2016.",
