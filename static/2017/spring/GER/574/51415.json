And, it supposedly ended around 1850. In this course, however, we will test the notion that Romanticism is still with us, in various guises. Texts from Mary Shelley?s Frankenstein (1818) to Christoph Ransmayr?s The Terrors of Ice and Darkness (1996), contemporary films, and core works of German Romanticism will help students develop a clear understanding of the movement, of its impacts, and of important trends in literary, philosophical, and cultural history since the late eighteenth century.    This course is for graduate and undergraduate students. Readings and discussions are in English, with no prerequisites. Graduate students in German should read the course texts in German (and may choose to write essays in German), and undergraduate German majors/minors are encouraged to do so.   This course is an affiliated seminar with the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory.   More information about the course is available at laurieruthjohnson.weebly.com, and from the instructor at lruthjoh@illinois.edu.","sectionTitle":"Romanticism and Its Afterlives","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
