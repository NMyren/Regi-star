    "description": "This course explores how we access and generate knowledge. In formal education, the legacy classroom is also being augmented with technology or replaced entirely with online learning. Across a wide range of domains of knowledge, the traditional separations between knowledge producers (experts or teachers) and knowledge consumers (everyday citizens or students) are undergoing transformation. In this course you will be exposed to the changing landscape of knowledge and learning through a hands-on experience of collaborative knowledge production and learning. Issues and concepts to be addressed include Web 2.0, participatory media, peer-to-peer knowledge networks, 'the commons', informal online learning, and the dynamics of formal e-learning ecologies.",
