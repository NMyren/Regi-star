{"creditHours":"2 hours.","description":"An introductory course in American Sign Language (ASL); no previous knowledge or skills are needed. It is offered through the Living in Residence Program at Allen Hall. The focus is on the acquisition of beginning-level vocabulary items and grammar of ASL. ASL is a non-Indo-European language that uses the visual/manual rather than spoken/auditory modality. Students develop a core vocabulary and basic grammar to enable you to communicate using ASL. The Deaf Community, like other cultural groups, defines a population that shares both a language and pattern of transmission of beliefs and values. The course provides an introduction to the culture, traditions, and values of the Deaf Community.","href":"/2017/spring/SHS/111.json","id":"SHS 111","label":"Living-Learning ASL Part 1","parents":{"calendarYear":{"href":"/2017.json","id":"2017","label":"2017"},"subject":{"href":"/2017/spring/SHS.json","id":"SHS","label":"Speech and Hearing Science"},"term":{"href":"/2017/spring.json","id":"120171","label":"Spring 2017"}},"sections":[{"href":"/2017/spring/SHS/111/56990.json","id":"56990","label":"U12"},{"href":"/2017/spring/SHS/111/56991.json","id":"56991","label":"WE1"}]}
