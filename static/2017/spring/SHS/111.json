    "description": "An introductory course in American Sign Language (ASL); no previous knowledge or skills are needed. It is offered through the Living in Residence Program at Allen Hall. The focus is on the acquisition of beginning-level vocabulary items and grammar of ASL. ASL is a non-Indo-European language that uses the visual/manual rather than spoken/auditory modality. Students develop a core vocabulary and basic grammar to enable you to communicate using ASL. The Deaf Community, like other cultural groups, defines a population that shares both a language and pattern of transmission of beliefs and values. The course provides an introduction to the culture, traditions, and values of the Deaf Community.",
