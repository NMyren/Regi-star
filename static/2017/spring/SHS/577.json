The advanced practicum is designed for students with more than a year of supervised clinical experience (i.e., more than 100 contact hours as defined by the American Speech-Language and Hearing Association-ASHA). Working within a clinical team, the advanced practicum will provide students with: 1) supported opportunities to assist in all aspects of clinical practice (e.g., diagnosis, intervention, documentation, team meetings/planning); 2) take lead clinician and/or case management roles for some cases; 3) opportunities to obtain supervised contact hours required by the ASHA for certification in Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology. May be repeated with approval. Prerequisite: SHS 477.",
