Key concepts will include probability, impacts, risk, uncertainty, statistical estimation, and decision making. Students will use simple risk analysis methods to apply these concepts to example problems related to drought, flooding, weather extremes, and anthropogenic climate change. The students will learn the R programming language for statistical computing, which will be used to integrate concepts and methods using observational data sets and model output.
