Each week will explore a particular concept, including readings on the notion itself, public address that exemplifies it in action, and larger theoretical projects to which it has contributed. I hope in this way to work in the middle ground between text and theory. Students will spend the semester working on a seminar paper and this should be an excellent choice for a methods requirement.","sectionTitle":"Conceptual Criticism","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
