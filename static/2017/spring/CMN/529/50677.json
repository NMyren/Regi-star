This course examines the theoretical reasoning and statistical principles that govern measurement. The course is designed to cultivate the conceptual and statistical skills necessary for operationalizing constructs. The first part of the class will focus on how to formulate a conceptual definition of a construct. Then, the class will examine measurement issues associated with both continuous variables and categorical variables. Specific topics include reliability, validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, physiological measures, content analysis, and coding and rating schemes. Assignments will require students to grapple with measurement issues relevant to their own scholarship. The course is open to graduate students interested in all domains of quantitative research. Familiarity with linear regression procedures is required.","sectionTitle":"Comm & Rel Development","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
