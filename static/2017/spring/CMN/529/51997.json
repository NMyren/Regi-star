We will draw on literatures from Communication, Management, and Information Science to explore how diverse knowledge can benefit organizations, the challenges produced by such diversity, and the mechanisms for overcoming these knowledge barriers. Along the way we will also consider the complex ways that communication technologies relate with knowledge management processes. Topics covered will include but are not limited to: interdisciplinary teams, expertise, communities of practice, transactive memory, knowledge networks, data representations, boundary objects, and knowledge management systems.",
