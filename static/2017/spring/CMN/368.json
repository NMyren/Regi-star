    "description": "Describes sex as a fundamental activity in the development and maintenance of human relationships. Communication about sex happens in a variety of interpersonal, group, organizational, and mediated contexts. Explores the many ways in which sexual communication intersects our personal, relational, cultural, and institutional norms and values. Topics will include social norms about sexual communication, sexual harassment, family communication about sex, sexual health education, doctor-patient communication about sex, and sex in the media and in advertising. Theory and research on communication processes will be used to elaborate how talk about sex can achieve multiple goals.",
