    "description": "Using the critical lens of theories on race, class, gender, and sexuality, this class will investigate the complicated relations among popular media and culture, including how our everyday life and attitudes are thought to be shaped by the media, and how cultural systems can be said to inform the media. By exploring a wide range of media (e.g., film, television, music, the internet, and computer games), students will investigate the national, political, and personal dimensions of popular media and the varied ways in which media construct, reflect and intersect with specific cultural systems, identities, and classifications. May be repeated in separate terms to a maximum of 6 hours.",
