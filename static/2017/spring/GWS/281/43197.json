Starting with Queen Elizabeth I and ending with Hilary Clinton, however, we will do so by coupling two very different periods of literary history in two countries. This will help us to think, inter-historically, about the continuities and divergences in the production and circulation of ?images of women? in the cultural and literary imagination, as well as the multiple methodologies we can bring to such a topic.  We will begin in Renaissance England by approaching gender from a historicist angle: what were the particular contours of gender hierarchy at this moment? How might iterations of patriarchy and its subversion or rejection be historically specific? In what ways are gender norms yoked to broader and historically-determined socio-political structures and assumptions about sexual identity, marriage, and the reproduction and dissemination of state power? In the second half of the course we will change tack, using feminist and queer theory in particular to add new questions as we consider recent, twentieth- and twenty-first American texts and public culture. We will ask to what extent can gender be considered a performance and what are the implications of doing so? How might theories of racial difference, sexuality, and transgender identity complicate, even undo, any sense of a stable or unified category of ?woman?? To what extent and how does gender remain a useful category of analysis, politically or culturally, in our present moment?","sectionTitle":"Women in Public Culture","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
