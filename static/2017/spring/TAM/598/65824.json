It has strong athematics components, including an introduction to both variational calculus and differential geometry. Students will learn rigorous treatment of biological/soft matter topics relevant in current research, such as network and membrane mechanics, adhesion, and entropic effects. Practical exercises in numerical simulation are integrated into the course.","sectionTitle":"Soft Solids","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
