ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 include two lectures each week and one weekly small discussion meeting for more individual attention. ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 are independent offerings and can be taken in any order. While ASTR 100, ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 are for non-science majors, problem solving with basic algebra is required. Science and astronomy majors should take ASTR 210.","courseSectionInformation":"Credit is not given for ASTR 100 if credit in any of ASTR 121, ASTR 122, ASTR 210, or equivalent has been earned.
