    "description": "A project-focused course covering fundamental principles of user interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Small teams work on a term-long project that involves: analysis of the problem domain, user skills, and tasks; iterative prototyping of interfaces to address user needs; conducting several forms of evaluation such as cognitive walkthroughs and usability tests; implementation of the final prototype. Non-technical majors may enroll as non-programmers who participate in all aspects of the projects with the possible exception of implementation. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 or 4 graduate hours.
