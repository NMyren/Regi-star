The course will study emerging applications with the goal of understanding the challenge of programming them.  It will include a survey of programming languages currently used as well as novel programming languages proposed for applications in these domains.  Students will be expected to do a course project exploring novel programming constructs for a specific domain of next generation applications.","sectionTitle":"Progming Languages Application","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
