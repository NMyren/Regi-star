The last two decades have witnessed the development of a rich theory in this area and deep mathematical connections have been established. The first half of the course will provide a broad introduction to games and market models, solution concepts, classical as well as recent developments in the field on equilibrium computation & complexity, mechanism design, price of anarchy, matching markets, game dynamics, and others. The second half will address a selection of advanced topics and research projects.",
