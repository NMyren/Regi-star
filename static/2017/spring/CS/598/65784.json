Many geometric problems can be viewed as generalizations of standard one-dimensional searching. We will discuss fundamental techniques and recent theoretical developments for basic problems such as point location, orthogonal and nonorthogonal range searching, dynamic convex hulls, and approximate nearest neighbors. We will also explore geometric data structures in a variety of settings, from the word RAM model to computational models inspired by big data, including external memory and streaming.  Prerequisite: an undergraduate algorithms course.","sectionTitle":"Geometric Data Structures","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
