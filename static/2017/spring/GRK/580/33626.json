This period is often called by way of shorthand (The Second Sophistic) after a style of oratory that was popular at the time, but numerous other types of Greek literary texts were composed and circulated as well. We will examine several key texts, both poetry and prose but primarily prose, that exemplify the major literary trends of the period and illuminate the concerns of the Greek-speaking communities of the Empire. Issues covered will include ethnicity and imperialism, gender, canon-formation, the relationship between Latin and Greek in the Empire, and the relationship between literature and other expressions of cultural identity.  Meets with PHIL 501.","sectionTitle":"The Second Sophistic","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
