Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The techniques involved include discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. The course is appropriate for graduate students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics; graduate students in the biological sciences are also welcome, and will have different homework and exams. Pre-requisites: No biology background is required, but students should have some mathematical maturity, and at least one undergraduate course in algorithm design, data structures, or probability theory. Students without this background (e.g., biology graduate students, or undergraduates in engineering who have not completed an algorithms course) may be admitted, but should contact the instructor to discuss the course.","sectionTitle":"Algorithmic Genomic Biology","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
