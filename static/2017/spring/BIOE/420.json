Introduces open loop and closed loop feedback control; Laplace and Fourier analysis of system behavior; impulse and steady state responses; physiological modeling and system identification; and stability. Includes biological systems for endocrine function, muscle position, neuronal circuits, and cardiovascular function. Mathematical modeling, Matlab and Simulink simulation, and physiological measurements to relate control systems to maintenance of internal environment. 3 undergraduate hours. No graduate credit.
