Students will be exposed to sustainability models being embraced by leagues, teams, and events to increase revenues and reduce costs and analyze strategies managers implement to raise community awareness of social issues. Class will meet regularly in an electronic format and in arranged classroom meetings. For information please contact the Instructor, Dr. Michael Raycraft.",
