An understanding of how government operates at the intersection of technology and policy is vital to the modern engineer's professional knowledge-base. This course provides an introduction to the role of government in setting world wide technology agendas and the role that engineers must play in these discussions. This course will use a variety of examples to illustrate the influence of governmental decisions and their subsequent impact on society. The end goal of the course is to develop the engineer's understanding, vocabulary, and knowledge, of the role that legislation, executive agencies and even local governments have in this complex system. This course will be co-taught by experts, Gary Miller, Terry McLennand, Robert Bauer, and Rick Winkel.","sectionTitle":"Engineering and Public Policy","startDate":"2017-03-13-05:00","statusCode":"A"}
