Doing so will constitute duplicate credit that will not count toward graduation.  Students registering for the duplicate course will be asked to drop.  Note:  AGCM majors cannot use AGCM 315 to count toward ADV concentration. PLEASE NOTE:  Prerequisites will not be enforced this semester; HOWEVER, either AGCM 220 or ADV 150 is strongly suggested.  Students who have not taken AGCM 220 or ADV 150 MUST have CONSENT OF INSTRUCTOR.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
