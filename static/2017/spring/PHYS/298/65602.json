    "sectionText": "You will learn to do remarkable things. By the end of the first week you will calculate the trajectory of a relativistic starship and confirm an insight of Ramanujan, the \"Man Who Knew Infinity.\" A week after that you will generate diagrams of spacetime curvature around black holes. You will determine the slingshot trajectory for a tour of the gas giants and calculate pi using simulated toothpicks. There will be chaos, and fractal geometry, and pattern recognition in noisy environments. You will learn that a Python is not just a snake, nor a Spyder just an arachnid. And you will be pioneers: you are going to help us change the way we teach undergraduate physics at the University of Illinois.",
