This course will meet April 6, 13, 20, and 27th for classroom instruction and will culminate in a field experience from May 15th to 19th at the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center (NGRREC) in East Alton, IL. The National Great Rivers Research and Education Center, located at the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri Rivers, is offering a two-week summer field course focused on large river floodplain ecology. Students will work directly in large river floodplain ecosystems, which generally consist of a mosaic of land and water containing bottomland forests, grasslands, islands, backwaters, sloughs, side channels, and wetlands. Students will learn how historic management practices have impacted these river systems, and how current science-based approaches to management and ecological restoration are impacting river health and sustainability. Monitoring the biological and physical components of riverine habitats is a key part of this process, and students will become familiar with the types of quantitative assessments common to the field of river ecology. Course fee required. Students are responsible for their own transportation to NGRREC. If all seats are full, complete the form at http://go.illinois.edu/NRESwaitinglist to be added to the waiting list.",
