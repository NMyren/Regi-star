    "description": "Documentary has exploded in the past decade, with more being created, screened and watched than at any time in history. But what has this growth meant to documentary, and how has it impacted what we see on screen and how documentary stories are being told? We will examine the changes and trends taking place in film and television documentaries over the past decade. We will watch and analyze a variety of contemporary documentaries, examining some of the different stylistic, production, and story-telling methods that have developed over this time. If you enjoy watching documentaries and want to learn more about them, you will find this an enjoyable and thought-provoking course.",
