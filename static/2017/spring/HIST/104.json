{"creditHours":"3 hours.","description":"What is black music, and how do we know what we think we know about it? Together, we will examine musical creations pioneered by Africans and individuals of African descent over several centuries and across hemispheres. Doing so will allow us to consider the unity of the African Diaspora and its music, and also examine internal differences and diversity. Special focus is given to Latin America and the U.S., but, depending on the semester, we will also read about, listen to, and talk about music and musicians in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most course assignments are multi-media and interactive.","genEdCategories":[{"description":"Cultural Studies: Non-Western/U.S. Minority Culture(s)","id":"CNW","attributes":[{"code":"1NW","label":"UIUC: Non-Western Cultures"}]},{"description":"Humanities & the Arts","id":"HUM","attributes":[{"code":"1HP","label":"UIUC: Hist&Philosoph Perspect"}]},{"description":"Cultural Studies: Non-Western/U.S. Minority Culture(s)","id":"CNW","attributes":[{"code":"1US","label":"UIUC: US Minority Culture(s)"}]}],"href":"/2017/spring/HIST/104.json","id":"HIST 104","label":"Black Music","parents":{"calendarYear":{"href":"/2017.json","id":"2017","label":"2017"},"subject":{"href":"/2017/spring/HIST.json","id":"HIST","label":"History"},"term":{"href":"/2017/spring.json","id":"120171","label":"Spring 2017"}},"sectionDegreeAttributes":"Hist&Philosoph Perspect, Non-Western Cultures, and US Minority Culture(s) course.","sections":[{"href":"/2017/spring/HIST/104/65247.json","id":"65247","label":"AD1"},{"href":"/2017/spring/HIST/104/65248.json","id":"65248","label":"AD2"},{"href":"/2017/spring/HIST/104/65249.json","id":"65249","label":"AD3"},{"href":"/2017/spring/HIST/104/65246.json","id":"65246","label":"AL1"}]}
