Topic:  American Empire:  Global Power and Its Limits Description:  The term \"American empire\" has undergone a resurgence in the twenty-first century, made relevant to contemporary discussions of U.S. global power by a series of traumatic events from 9/11 and the \"war on terror,\" to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, to the current dilemmas over Syria and the South China Sea, which suggest U.S. imperial limitations.  In this course, we will trace the development of the United States as a world power in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, exploring debates about its status as an empire.  We will examine the formal colonial and the informal hegemonic nature of American power.  And we will also connect discussions of American Empire to other experiences of empire around the world.  In this course, the capstone for the history major, students will learn specifically the construction of a long research paper, engaging in original research that will allow them to explore a subject or theme in-depth.",
