Particular emphasis will be placed on the cultural, economic, and political structures and processes that shaped and continued to influence life in Mexico from its colonial past to modern day present.  Key issues such as colonialism, racism, mestizaje, the role of the Catholic Church, independence, the rise of the nation state, the Reforma, the Porfiriato, the Mexican Revolution(s), the economic \"miracle,\" and US-relations will all be examined critically - from time to time in light of comparative themes in Peru in order to discuss the singularity of Mexico's history.  Course materials include secondary sources as well as primary documents, literature, paintings, and film in order to provide insights into the complex and diverse history of the region.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
