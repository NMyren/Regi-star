    "description": "Introduction to one of the most transformative events in early modern world history: the creation of the Russian Empire. We will study how Moscow, a modest medieval kingdom, suddenly expanded into the world's largest state, fated to play an outsized role in world politics and culture. Chronologically, the course extends from 1500-1750, and considers topics ranging from religion and rebellion to material culture and everyday life.",
