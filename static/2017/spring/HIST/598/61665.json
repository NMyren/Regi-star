Members of the Pedagogy Seminar will 1) read about ad discuss theoretical and practical issues in teaching; 2) prepare a polished syllabus that can be included in job applications; 3) prepare a teaching portfolio that can be included in job applications; and 4) gain evidence on their transcript of having received pedagogy training.  Students in other fields are welcome if there is room.",
