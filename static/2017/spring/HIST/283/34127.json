Most do not even see themselves as \"Asian American.\"  How then can we speak of \"Asian American history?\"  What issues arise in trying to incorporate this diversity into one historical narrative, one story?  In this course, we will attempt to grapple with this problem.  We will relate the activity and the historical circumstances Asian Americans have faced in the United States to the themes of capitalism and democracy, unity and difference that have challenged all Americans.  We will examine the reasons why men and women of the Asian continent migrated to what is today the United States, the ways they establish communities and related across generational divides, the challenges of racism, gender, discrimmination, and class exploitation they faced, and the ways they responded to their new conditions.  We will explore Asian American history using primary sources, literature, and film as our windows.","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
