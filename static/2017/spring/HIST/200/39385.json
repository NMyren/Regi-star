We will engage with a wide range of films, from classics such as Roshomon to modern features like Hero, and consider how they shed light on the perspectives and plot forms that shape historical writing.  Alongside these films, we will read a selection of important theoretical texts that examine the connections between history and other forms of storytelling.  Throughout, we will contemplate how the histories that we write are shaped by our own contested values and beliefs.",
