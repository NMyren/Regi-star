A racial revolution of prison riots and black elected officials.  The flowering of Democratic liberalism but also the emergence of the New Right conservative movement.  A generation whose protests intervenend in the war in Vietnam ends the decade by electing perhaps the most conservative president of the twentieth century.  This course shows how research into primary sources about this fascinating period sheds new light on the cultural and political struggles of our own times.",
