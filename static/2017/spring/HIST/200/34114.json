A gender revolution of gay liberation, pornography and feminism.  A racial revolution of prison riots and black elected officials.  The flowering of Democratic liberalism but also the emergence of the New Right conservative movement.  A generation whose protests intervenend in the war in Vietnam ends the decade by electing perhaps the most conservative president of the twentieth century.
