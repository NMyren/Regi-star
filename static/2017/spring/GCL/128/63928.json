In this class we think about how stories help us to explore these connections to food, water, and energy.  Turning the campus into our lab and our readings into inspiration, we will source meals and embark on field trips.  We will read memorable works of literature from different parts of the world including popular dystopic fiction (\"cli-fi\").","sectionTitle":"Food, Water, Energy","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
