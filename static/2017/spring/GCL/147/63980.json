Students will, in person and virtually, walk and talk with especially inner city residents to document how they challenge and sometimes change persistent political policies that racially re-segregate urban from suburban neighborhoods. Specifically, students will work with neighborhood residents to map their struggles against spatial segregation and social inequality. Final mapping projects will be shared online with residents at the end of the semester.","sectionTitle":"Race and the City","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
