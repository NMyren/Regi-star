Specifically, we will consider the cultural distinctions between animals considered \"pets\" and those considered \"food\" animals, both in U.S. and international contexts. Students will combine hands-on experiential learning at a local animal shelter with scholarly reflection, and will conduct original problem- solving research, which will be presented in a format designed to engage a wider community outside the classroom.","sectionTitle":"Humans and Animals","startDate":"2017-01-17-06:00","statusCode":"A"}
