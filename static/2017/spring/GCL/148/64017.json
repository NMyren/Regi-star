    "sectionText": "We are equal before the law, but what about the rest of our lives? Is economic inequality bad? Is international inequality more acceptable than national inequality? We will study the history of the justifications for inequality in light of what economists, sociologists and philosophers think, today, of inequality. By the end of the course, you will be able to engage the major arguments in support of inequality knowing their history, their weaknesses, and their relation to the larger historical context. We will study inequality and its justifications as some of the crucial pillars of political conflicts and we will learn how the notion of inequality changed over time. We will interview economists, sociologists and other experts to learn what the current debate is. A final undergraduate conference/debate will allow us to test the quality of our work and face the experts with informed and difficult questions.",
