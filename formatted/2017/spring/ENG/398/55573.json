UI students work in teams with students from the University of Pretoria on community-based STEM projects with schools and nonprofit partners. Students learn about the context for engagement, including exploration of the history of apartheid, challenges of its legacy of inequalities and poverty, and the role of civic engagement in post-apartheid transformation. Students explore theories, concepts, and critiques in global service-learning and engage in critical reflection about citizenship and communities, engineering problem-solving within a sociocultural context, and engineering education for social justice. Priority enrollment for First-year and Sophomore Engineering students. Travel costs paid separately. Historical, cultural, and wildlife excursions will be included in the summer study tour.
