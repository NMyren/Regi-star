Understanding and exploring both outward and inward representations of self creates a critical mix in how a leader is seen and perceived. Students will develop, deepen, and master their abilities to effect how they are publicly perceived as leaders and how creative explorations can expand their abilities and perceptions to fully encompass a leadership presence. In addition to regular meeting times, students will be required to attend 10 KCPA performances.   Meets in Illinois Street Residence Hall Room 29B.",
