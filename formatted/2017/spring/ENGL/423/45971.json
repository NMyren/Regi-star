    "sectionText": "This course introduces you to one of the greatest British writers?John Milton.  Milton was a blind seer, a regicidal prose-writer, and an inspired poet.  He also wrote arguably the most ambitious English epic, one that aimed to explain the origins of life itself: Paradise Lost.  This class will explore Milton?s prodigious and ostentatiously learned output in the context of his own life and the historical turmoil of the mid-seventeenth century that transformed it. We will focus on the complex issues of religion, gender, and politics he engages, looking at his often contradictory responses to the ideas, literature, and men and women of his time. We will also trace his carefully crafted public image, thinking about Milton?s view of the role of poetry and polemic within a revolutionary historical context.",
