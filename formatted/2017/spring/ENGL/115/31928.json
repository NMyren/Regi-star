    "sectionText": "This course is designed to acquaint students with examples of the rich diversity of British prose, poetry, and drama.  Works selected will vary from section to section, but instructors usually rely upon the Norton Anthology of English Literature, Major Authors Ed., along with a few supplementary paperbacks, for the assigned readings.  As a basic introduction to English literature, this course does not offer a complete chronological survey of all or even most major writers.  It offers instead a series of literary texts, often thematically related, which appeal to modern readers and at the same time provide interesting insights into the cultural attitudes and values of the periods which produced them.",
