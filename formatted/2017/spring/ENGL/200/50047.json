    "sectionText": "This course is designed to help students develop analytical skills that will be crucial to their success in 300- and 400-level courses in literary and cultural studies.  We will spend several weeks on each of the three primary literary genres taught in the English Department?poetry, prose fiction, and drama?paying close attention both to the defining characteristics that distinguish the genres from one another and to the structural elements they have in common.  Throughout the semester, we will build up a critical vocabulary for articulating persuasive, detailed, and evidence-based arguments about literary texts, and we will think about interpretation itself as a form of action with political, ethical, and social-historical implications. Requirements: regular attendance and participation, informal responses, three essays.",
