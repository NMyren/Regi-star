    "sectionText": "Topic Section E: The Teaching of Literature This seminar concentrates on preparing graduate students to teach literature courses in three of the most common pedagogical genres within English studies: the introductory-level course for non-majors, the national or period literature survey course for majors, and the upper-division topic seminar. We will read and discuss some pedagogical theory, but the class will primarily focus on the practical, with an eye toward generating a teaching portfolio containing documents of value on the academic job market: a statement of teaching philosophy, sample syllabi for each genre of course, sample lesson plans for the same, and sample course assignments. This portfolio will be put together week by week during the semester, and much of it will be generated and revised through peer review?expect to talk to one another about not only planning for the literature classroom but also about debriefing what happens within it! From time to time, I?ll bring in faculty speakers to share their own experiences grappling with pedagogical issues.",
