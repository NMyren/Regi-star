In this course we will view a selection of films released in the second half of the twentieth century that have librarians as their main protagonists. In association with both primary sources and secondary readings we will use the films as vehicles for analyzing and discussing various phases of, and episodes in, US and UK library history. Restricted to LIS students only.  [First offered Spring 2013].",
