It includes literature review, problem statement, research design, methodology, identifying participants, IRB review and a final proposal paper. Students are expected to collect data for their study (project) between Parts I and II. Part II topics include data analysis, interpretation, discussion, implications, dissemination of findings, and future research. Leads to a final research (capstone) paper that synthesizes work from Part I and adds to it through data analysis, discussion of findings, implications, and ways to disseminate findings to relevant audiences.
