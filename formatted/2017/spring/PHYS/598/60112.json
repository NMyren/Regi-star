This course will give students a working knowledge of the AdS/QFT correspondence, and its applications in particle physics, hydrodynamics, fluid mechanics, and condensed matter physics. Although students will benefit from having already a good knowledge of quantum field theory (such as from Physics 582-583), all other necessary material will be introduced in class, including rudimentary material on general relativity and string theory. Throughout the course, we will collaboratively develop code using Mathematica and/or Matlab to calculate interesting holographic observables.",
