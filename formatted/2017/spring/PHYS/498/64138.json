The creations have led to a deeper understanding of nature, to giving the arts a new dimension, to friendly and enchanting ways of perceiving science in action, to tremendous technological progres, and to pure fun!  In this course students will gain exposure to the exciting ways in which science has joined hands with a broad spectrum of the arts, inclusive of the visual arts, theater, music, literature, and more, and to the marvelous creations that have emerged from this synergy.  Going beyond analyzing this synergy, students will become creators themselves by using the knowledge gained in the course, forming teams, learning from one another, and  working on projects that result in mini-productions using their choice of media.  Course will meet in the IDEA Lab, Grainger Library  Contact:  Prof. Vishveshwara smivish@illinois.edu  Please briefly describe in what way you would find bringing together the arts and physics interesting, as well as your experience with either,  be it through courses or otherwise.",
