    "sectionText": "This course offers a thematic approach to the study of Middle Eastern politics. We will cover the major areas of political science research on the contemporary Middle East while simultaneously building empirical knowledge about the politics of individual countries in the region. In addition to identifying broad trends in the political, social, and economic development of the region and critically evaluating existing explanations for these trends, the course will help students develop strategies for testing theoretically-driven hypotheses using analytic tools of the modern social sciences. Topics to be covered include: state capacity and democracy; economic development and mineral resources; the politics of religion and gender; political violence and revolution.  Restricted to Political Science majors until November 14, 2016.",
