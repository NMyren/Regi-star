This course assumes familiarity with and proficiency in solving intermediate-difficulty algorithmic programming problems using dynamic programming, graph algorithms, mathematics, computational geometry, combinatorial games, and standard library data structures. This course is recommended for students hoping to learn how to solve difficult problems that appear in the ACM ICPC World Finals contest and later stages of multi-stage programming contests. The course requires completion of short problem sets and participation in practice contests.",
