    "sectionText": "Topic: Distributed Social Sensing and Cyber-Physical Systems. In 2007, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) named systems that interact with the physical world the number one research challenge for US competitiveness. An important emerging category of cyber-physical systems are those that function in social spaces. These systems are ushered in by the proliferation of \"sensing\"  devices (e.g., on phones, in homes, on cameras, etc) in the possession of the average individual, as well as our ubiquitous mobile connectivity and the rise of new data broadcast media (namely, social networks). This course covers the unfolding research challenges and directions in distributed social sensing, overviews the broader landscape of cyber-physical systems, discusses common misconceptions, presents the underlying theoretical foundations, and sheds light on related recent technologies and publications.",
