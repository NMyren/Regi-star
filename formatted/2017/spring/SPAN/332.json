    "description": "Entrepreneurship means more than starting a business. This course emphasizes social entrepreneurship, in which the basic process of entrepreneurship-opportunity recognition, resource gathering and value creation is used to address social issues, not to create profits. Students do community-based learning in non-profits serving the local Spanish-speaking community, thereby building their language skills, acquiring cultural knowledge and gaining hands-on experience with social entrepreneurship (theory and practice). Each week class meets two hours in class and two hours in community-based service work. Prerequisite: SPAN 228.",
