    "sectionText": "Description: Emotion is a double-edged sword - in some circumstances the enhanced significance of emotional stimuli can benefit cognitive processes (e.g. better memory for emotional events), while in others it can hinder them and cause detrimental effects on behavior (e.g., increased emotional distractibility). On the other hand, emotion processing is also susceptible to cognitive influences (e.g., cognitive control of emotion). Despite their relevance for understanding brain function in both healthy and clinical conditions, the neural mechanisms mediating the interactions between emotion and cognition are not well understood. This seminar will discuss current topics in the literature on emotion-cognition interactions, with a focus on the associated neural correlates.",
