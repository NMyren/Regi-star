This course provides an introduction to the scientific study of human intelligence, with particular emphasis on modern research in cognitive neuroscience. For centuries the nature of human intelligence has motivated considerable research and debate: What does it mean for humans to be intelligent? What mental abilities does intelligence refer to? How are these abilities shaped by the environment, cultivated through experience, and represented in the human brain? This course addresses these questions through the lens of modern research in psychology, psychometrics, and cognitive neuroscience. Students interested in the nature and mechanisms of human intelligence from basic, clinical, and applied disciplines will find this course useful.  *Approved for General Psychology Concentration**",
