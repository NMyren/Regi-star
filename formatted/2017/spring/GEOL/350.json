    "description": "Explores volcanoes from a hazards standpoint by investigating case studies of volcanic disaster, evaluating important controls of volcanism such as magma viscosity and behavior of bubbles, and introducing the monitoring of active volcanoes with cutting edge methods such as seismicity, gravity, and remote sensing. Understanding the interactions among these complex parameters plays a critical role in assessing the evolution of shallow magma systems and investigating their potential for remaining stable or developing into hazardous eruptive systems, which can threaten nearby populations.
