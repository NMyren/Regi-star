Topics to be discussed include: residential segregation, housing access, environmental racism, health disparities, educational inequalities, and discrimination in hiring/labor relations. While the focus will be on structural patterns of inequality, readings will also address the day-to-day practices that produce and sustain these racial disparities.",
