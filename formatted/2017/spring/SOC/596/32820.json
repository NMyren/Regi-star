    "sectionText": "Topic:   COMPARATIVE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS SYSTEMS  Examines employment systems in selected developed, newly industrialized, and developing economies, focusing on, but not limited to, Asian economies. Discusses how distinctive labor market institutions emerged in the context of rapid economic development and evolved through interactions with the global economy. Topics include management-labor relations, and the roles of firms, national governments, and international organizations in shaping employment systems. Emphasis will be placed on the analytical tools needed to make multi-country comparisons, to link theory and practice, and to understand the reasons for major changes in the nature of employment relations.   Open to Ph.D. students in Sociology and MHRIR students at LER",
