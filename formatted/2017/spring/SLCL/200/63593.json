Reading across space and time from ancient Mesopotamia to medieval France, from colonial Nigeria to modern Siberia, we decipher ancient alphabets, translate poetry, conduct sociolinguistic research, and make films. As we study language loss and reclamation, we also learn together the basics of Myaamia-Peoria, the language once spoken by the native peoples of Central Illinois and Indiana that is in the process of being reclaimed by their descendants.",
