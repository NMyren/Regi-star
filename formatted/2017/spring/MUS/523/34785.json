    "sectionText": "This course explores the ways that connections between the body, medicine, and the visual and performing arts were negotiated in the chronological period coinciding with the European Middle Ages (roughly 400-1500 CE). The root of this study is the humoral theory of the body, which in various forms dominated medical across Europe and the Middle East for millennia and which in both Christian and Islamic contexts interacted with conceptions of the senses to influence artworks of many different media. From there, we will also explore the similarities and differences between the artful medicine or healing art produced within the humoral framework to that produced under other paradigms such as those operating in the same period within India and east Asia.Meets with MDVL 500/523B",
