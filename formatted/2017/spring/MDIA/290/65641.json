We will view excerpts from films that include All the President?s Men, The Insider, Page One, and Spotlight and talk about the differences between stereotypes of investigative journalists and how the journalists actually work. The course also will include a historical overview of investigative journalism, how it has developed in sophistication and approaches, and its presentation in films over the past 80 years.",
