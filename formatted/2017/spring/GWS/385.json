    "description": "Investigates the ways in which sexual identities change as national contexts change, as borders are imagined, valued, and crossed, and as definitions of race, gender, and religion shift. Interrogates how national and transnational identities (at home and abroad), modernites, histories, and colonial and global narratives are built on ideas of racialized sexualities, and as such, is particularly interested in the study of queer diaspora. Importantly, this course utilizes transnational feminist frameworks for re-thinking issues related to sexuality, immigration, nation-building, race and gender. Areas of inquiry include imperialism, immigration, war, tourism and globalization. Same as HIST 385. Prerequisite: GWS 100, GWS 201 or GWS 202 or consent of instructor.",
