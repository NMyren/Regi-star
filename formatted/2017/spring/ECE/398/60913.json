Making sense of all this data in the relevant context is a critical question. This course takes a holistic view towards understanding how this data is collected, represented and stored, retrieved and computed/analyzed upon to finally arrive at appropriate outcomes for the underlying context. The course is divided into three parts, with the first part focusing on foundations of machine learning, and the remaining two on specific application areas.   Prerequisites: ECE 313 (or campus equivalent on basic undergrad probability) and some basic linear algebra. General mathematical maturity expected of engineering undergraduates. Target Audience: Juniors or Seniors",
