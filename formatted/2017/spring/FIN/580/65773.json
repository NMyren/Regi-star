This section is open to off-campus students only and explores how financial investments can affect decisions, strategy, and ultimately business operations as well as personal portfolio. We will study and use risk-return models, such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and multi-factor models to evaluate the performance of various securities and portfolios. Building upon this framework, learn about market efficiency and behavioral finance as common behavioral biases of investors are introduced. Also see their potential effects on wealth accumulation and asset prices. We will also analyze money-management strategies and performance by institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds. Finally, connect investment finance with corporate finance by examining firm valuation techniques.",
