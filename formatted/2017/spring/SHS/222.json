    "description": "Students will learn about culture and how it is manifested in various subgroups of society with a particular focus on the culture and language of Deaf people in the United States. Themes include: the linguistics of American Sign Language, aspects of social unity for Deaf people, common experiences of Deaf individuals, the educational system and Deaf students, and current issues that affect the Deaf community. For those students requiring 4 semesters of language other than English credit (LAS or BUS), SHS 222 can be used as the fourth course in the American Sign Language sequence that includes SHS 121, 221, and 321 to fulfill that requirement but cannot also then be used for Gen Ed requirements. Same as EPSY 222.",
