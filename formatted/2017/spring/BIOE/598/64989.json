Emphasis will be on comparing and contrasting the physio-chemical rate processes that govern the function of stem cell niches and solid tumor microenvironments. Topics will include: (i) Cell migration, mitosis, apoptosis, and differentiation; (ii) Cellular responsiveness to soluble and immobilized factors that mediate interactions between cells, with extracellular matrix, and growth factor communication; (iii) Biophysical and bioengineering aspects of mechanotransduction, the process through which living cells sense and respond to their mechanical environment. Students will conduct a semester-long team project for additional credit.  Prerequisite: Prior coursework in and working knowledge of cellular and molecular biology.",
