    "description": "This is a hands-on course for students interested in exploring the relationship between dance and camera and the fundamentals of dance documentation. Using critical and experiential approach, we will explore the technical and artistic capabilities of mini-DV cameras and film-editing software to create dance performance documentation. Students will learn to execute clear and effective camerawork in relationship to dance performance, and to utilize editing software to most clearly display the artistic intent of the choreographers and directors. May be repeated up to 8 hours in separate terms. Prerequisite: For majors only, or by instructor approval.",
