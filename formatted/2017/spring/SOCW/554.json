    "description": "Examines issues raised by race, ethnicity, and class in the context of a diverse American society so that students may critically analyze the complexity these bring to the creation and implementation of public policy, service delivery, as well as governance and politics. Emphasizes both the processes of critical analysis and principles of social entrepreneurship as important vehicles to bring about sustainable change. Effective social policies and interventions in a diverse society are characterized by a demonstrable reduction of social tensions at the community level as well as increased access to social goods such as adequate housing, safe communities, efficient transportation, affordable health care, quality education, and other public goods and services. Same as HDFS 541 and LLS 554. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: SOCW 451 or consent of instructor for non Social Work majors.",
