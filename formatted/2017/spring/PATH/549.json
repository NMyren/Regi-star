    "description": "This course is aimed at veterinary students and anatomic pathology residents. This is an imaged-based course where interpretation of gross lesions will be taught for organ systems of a variety of different veterinary species. Veterinary students will receive weekly orientation to gross lesions by system with an image and discussion based format, and then will take mock ACVP boards-style gross exams followed by a group discussion of the exam. Pathology residents will take mock ACVP board-style gross exams. Veterinary students meet twice a week for an 8 week block and pathology residents meet once a week for the semester. 1 graduate hour. 1 professional hour. Approved for letter or S/U grading. May be repeated in separate terms for unlimited graduate or professional hours.",
