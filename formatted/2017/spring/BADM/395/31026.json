    "sectionText": "This course teaches a broadly applicable framework for negotiating effectively, with an emphasis on working with those from different cultures. Because business leaders depend on others to accomplish goals, they need to be skilled negotiators to generate solutions that are acceptable to others, valuable to others, and able to be implemented by others, whether those others are similar to or quite different from themselves. This course starts in April on campus to discuss foundations of negotiation and ends in Vienna May 17-26, where we will work together with students at WU in Vienna to develop our skills at negotiating across cultures.",
