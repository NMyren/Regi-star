In this seminar, students and I will bring data (e.g., existing meta-analytic data, survey data, scanner data, social media data, or experimental data) that need to be mined through the lenses of interesting and applicable business, psychological, or social theories. This seminar will involve intensive hands on research, with readings tailored to the methods, theories, and skills (e.g., writing, displaying results) required to ultimately produce complete research papers. If the proposed project exceeds the time expected for the class, additional research credit may be offered though the Business School or the Psychology Department.",
