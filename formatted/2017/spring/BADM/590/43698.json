Primary attention will be given to the content domains, presuppositions, core propositions, chains of reasoning that underlie a body of organizational scholarship. However, theory is grasped not only in the weighty tomes of pure theorists but also in the empirical research that aims to determine the veracity or falsity of theoretical ideas.  We will also give attention to the research methods employed in organizational research, for any assessment of the findings or theoretical implications of research cannot be divorced from the methods used to gather and analyze data.",
