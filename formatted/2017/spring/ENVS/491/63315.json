Working group members cultivate proposals from the campus community to fund projects that will enhance the sustainability of the campus, and Committee members evaluate those proposals and decide which will be funded by student fee revenue.  Students who serve only on a topical working group are expected to canvass the campus community to solicit new proposals, work closely with prospective proposers to clarify and improve their proposals, and provide preliminary evaluation of submitted proposals to the Committee.  These students are expected to attend working group meetings and to provide comments in electronic form on submitted proposals.  Students who also serve on the Committee will be expected to attend Committee meetings, participate in the final evaluation and selection of proposals to be funded, and provide organizational leadership for the Committee.  Evaluation of proposals, both at the working group and Committee level, takes place through written comments in shared documents as well as in group discussions.  S/U Grading.",
