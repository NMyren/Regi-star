The course takes a holistic approach, delving into various body-mind practices as a lens for learning human anatomy. Quizzes on anatomical structures and movement analysis will be partnered with a personal, experiential research project. The course includes guests from the fields of yoga, physical therapy, and massage therapy, as well as a field trip to the dance neuroscience lab.",
