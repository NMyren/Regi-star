Students will conceive, plan, and begin writing novels for either Young Adults (ages 12 and up) or the Middle Grade crowd (ages 8-12).  We?ll have plenty of discussion about structure, world-building, character development, writing process, and market appeal. We?ll also read and discuss novels for these demographics, from authors such as Rainbow Rowell, Patrick Ness, Jerry Spinelli, and Ellen Raskin.",
