We will look at how historical,  political, social, and economic processes shape Palestinian and Israeli cinematic narratives, self-representation, the representation of the Other, the relationship to the land, diaspora, narratives of nation-building. We will take a cinematic journey from national to transnational film, from the revolutionary to the postmodern, from the collective to the individual, from hope to despair.",
