    "description": "A rigorous treatment of basic real analysis via metric spaces recommended for those who intend to pursue programs heavily dependent upon graduate level Mathematics. Metric space topics include continuity, compactness, completeness, connectedness and uniform convergence. Analysis topics include the theory of differentiation, Riemann-Darboux integration, sequences and series of functions, and interchange of limiting operations. As part of the honors sequence, this course will be rigorous and abstract. 3 undergraduate hours. No graduate credit. Credit is not given for both Math 424 and either Math 444 or Math 447. Approved for honors grading. Prerequisite: An honors section of MATH 347 or an honors section of MATH 416, and consent of the department.",
