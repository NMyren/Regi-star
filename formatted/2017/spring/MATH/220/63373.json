While the material consists of standard Math 220 topics, it will be taught with examples from the biological sciences using a special life sciences math textbook. It will include an introduction to R.  Placement in this course requires an adequate, recent score on the U of I ALEKS math placement exam, as described at  http://math.illinois.edu/ALEKS  Students planning to transfer to a life sciences major may e-mail mathadvising@illinois.edu with name, netid, UIN, current major, and \"BioCalculus approval request\" in order to request registration approval, space permitting.  Some approval requests will be held for consideration until November 18.",
