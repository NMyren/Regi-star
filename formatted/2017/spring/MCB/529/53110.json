Lectures will cover experimental design and methods as well as analytical issues, supported by reading of primary literature. Assignments will include the use of online or command-line bioinformatics tools.  Familiarity with eukaryotic molecular genetics is needed but advanced programming skills are not required.  This course will meet in 607 IGB.",
