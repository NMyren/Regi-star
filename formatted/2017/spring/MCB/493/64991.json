The course will focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic phenomenon but we will also cover applications to contemporary topics such as cancer, metabolism, aging, and tissue engineering. 3 undergraduate hours, 3 graduate hours.Prerequisite:  Undergrads- MCB 252 or consent of instructor.One semester of biochemistry is recommended.",
