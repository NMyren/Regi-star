It draws from contemporary theories of influence and persuasion to identify propaganda in the context of modern journalism, to delinerate differences between propaganda and information, and to assess the impact of propaganda on democratic decision making in the digital age. Particular attention is given to the news media practices and consumption patterns that unwittingly facilitate strategies of modern propagandists. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
