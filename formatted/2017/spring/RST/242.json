Traditional perspectives including colonial American, romantic, and science-based conservation are characterized, as well as revisionist themes aligned with gender, cultural pluralism, and societal meanings of parks and protected areas. Implications of diversity in cultural meanings toward nature are developed and provide the basis for assessing tenets of contemporary environmental policy and supporting concepts associated with community-based conservation.
