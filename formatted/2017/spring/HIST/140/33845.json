It focuses on the evolution of politics, ideas and religious beliefs, and social structures and conflicts.  The course examines how the West emerged through interaction with so-called \"outsider\" - such as Jews, Muslims, indigenous peoples of the New World, enslaved Africans, and women - who brought essential contributions to society and culture.  In the process, students gain a new understanding of the cultural fusions and conflicts that continue to define, and challenge, the West and the wider world.",
