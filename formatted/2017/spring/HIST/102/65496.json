We will be focusing on two historical moments:  the trial an Anne Hutchinson in Puritan New England, and the bohemian enclave of Greenwich Village in 1913.  Within these periods, issues of gender, religion, and ideology created dissension about priorities and self-definition as communities struggled for unity.  In this course, students will determine which interests will carry the day in each and thereby define the community.",
