Topic:  This course is a survey of U.S. history from the end of the Civil War and the destrution of slavery to the present.  It examines the development of the modern United States into a powerful, industrial econonmy and world power, the lives and goals of the many different people who built America, and social conflicts.  For decades, many Americans lived comfortably with stark contradictions between America's stated values of democracy and equality and the reality of restrictions on voting and discrimination, but those inequities gave rise to social movements, which radically changed the world that we now live in.  Or did they?",
