    "sectionText": "Topic: Ethnohistory in Colonial Latin America. Description:  To write about history of foreign people and of foreign lands was one of the great challenges authors faced in the great age of European explorations starting in the 15th and 16th centuries.  In this course we examine some of the most important ethnohistoric accounts of Latin America from the early modern times until the twentieth century.  We will explore how past historians struggled with some crucial issues western historians faced when writing history.  How did they, for example, deal with problems of evidence, objectivity, and chronology?  How did their methodologies change over time?  In the end, these ethnohistorians can serve as a mirror of our own historical methods.  While drawing on ethnohistoric account from the Andes and Mexico during the half millennium from the sixteenth to the twentieth century we enter some of the most vibrant debates about the identity of Latin America.  What about the impact of the Spanish heritage?  How did an indigenous identity evolve over time?  And, last but not least, what does \"Mestizo\" mean?",
