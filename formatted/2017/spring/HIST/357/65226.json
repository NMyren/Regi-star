However, as the twentieth century progressed French dominance waned.  How do we explain the changing status of this once invincible nation?  From World War II and the Vichy regime through occupation, collaboration and resistance, from Marxism and decolonization, through student revolutions and sexual revolutions, to French debates over Islam and terrorism, we will study the history of modern France with an aim towards understanding France's shifting identity in the postwar world.",
