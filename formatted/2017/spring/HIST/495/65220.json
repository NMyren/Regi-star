While we will examine the role of the major Cold War powers like the United States and Soviet Union, particular attention will be given to various 'Third World' sites such as Africa where the Cold War played out in very 'hot' conflicts.  The key factors that we will examine are intelligence agencies and their personnel, who played leading roles in how the Cold War itself was actually fought.",
