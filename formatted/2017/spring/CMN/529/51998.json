    "sectionText": "We will discuss how people use language in ways that signal a range of interactional and socio-cultural meanings.  We will explore a number of classic and contemporary approaches that address how language use both seems to ?reflect? and create interpersonal and sociocultural contexts.More specifically, we will cover a range of approaches to the study of the relationships between  language use and processes of social identification, often understood in terms of  seemingly more durable, broader-level rubrics, such as ethnicity, race,  class, gender, sexuality, the nation-state, diaspora, generation, etc. Although no previous background is required for this course, students must be willing, however, to read, synthesize, and discuss material from a range of disciplines.",
