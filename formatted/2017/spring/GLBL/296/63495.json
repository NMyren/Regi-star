    "sectionText": "This Global Studies 296 seminar will provide students with a general introduction to NGOs in development. The course will focus on major international players based in the global North like World Vision and Human Rights Watch, the rise of mega-NGOs of the global South such as BRAC, as well as a range of grassroots groupings in several locales that operate with no more than a handful of unpaid staff.  The course will be broad in scope, offering an overview of the work of NGOs in many places and sectors  as well as acquaint students with the debates over the effectiveness of the non-governmental organizations  and the appropriate role for them in the development process.",
