This orientation class will be announced in early January via E-mail to all students registered for the class. Typically, students register for 1 hour credit, but rarely it may be taken for 2 hours credit if extra shifts are taken, and a more detailed paper is written. The requirement for an hour credit is for a 2-3-page paper on late gestation and foaling to be submitted by the end of the semester (in addition to the 6 foal watch shifts).",
