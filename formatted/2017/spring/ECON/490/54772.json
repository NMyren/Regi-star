This section is restricted to MSPE students until the morning of January 9th.This course is an advanced economics course that focuses on micro-economic issues in developing countries with particular attention to empirical analyses and methodologies to address policy-relevant questions. The class alternates between lectures and computer lab work. In lecture, we discuss new ideas or concepts and the assigned readings primarily on topics related to health and education. The classroom labs apply these concepts to actual data using Stata. Students are expected to produce an original empirical research paper using micro-data, applying the ideas and concepts covered in class.",
