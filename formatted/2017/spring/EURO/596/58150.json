This inflow has challenged in the EU in a variety of unexpected ways, testing the resolve of Member States to maintain solidarity and respect the \"fundamental freedom\" of free movement. This course is structured around a focused investigation into the causes, reactions, and consequences of this mass migration of people into the European Union. It explores national and supranational policy reactions from both objective and philosophical standpoints. The course will also include a discussion about migrant integration, social cohesion, and national identities.  Prerequisite: MA in EU Studies Students. Other students with Instructor's consent.",
