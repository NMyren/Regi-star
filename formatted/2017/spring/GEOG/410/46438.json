We will examine debates within environmental history, anthropology, and geography as we work to understand what are called \"the politics of environmental knowledge.\" While the course is taught from a social sciences perspective, the intended audience includes those working in the natural sciences and humanities, as well as the social sciences. A broad range of viewpoints and background knowledges will enhance our experience in the virtual classroom and allow us to consider a wide range of meanings for \"sustainability\" and \"development.\"",
