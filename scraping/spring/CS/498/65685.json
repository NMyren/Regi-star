Techniques covered will be: regression including linear regression, multiple regression, regression forests and nearest neighbors regression; classification with various methods including logistic regression, support vector machines, nearest neighbors, simple boosting and decision forests; clustering with various methods including basic agglomerative clustering and k-means; resampling methods, including cross-validation and the bootstrap; model selection methods, including AIC, stepwise selection and the lasso; hidden Markov models; model estimation in the presence of missing variables; and neural networks, including deep networks. The course is intended to support students who wish to apply machine learning methods,and will focus on tool-oriented and problem-oriented exposition. Application areas include computer vision, natural language, interpreting accelerometer data, and understanding audio data. Prereq: A course in probability or statistics, a course in linear algebra, and some programming experience", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Computer Science major(s).
