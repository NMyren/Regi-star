The course will study emerging applications with the goal of understanding the challenge of programming them.  It will include a survey of programming languages currently used as well as novel programming languages proposed for applications in these domains.  Students will be expected to do a course project exploring novel programming constructs for a specific domain of next generation applications.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "S4 ", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "12:30 PM", "end": "01:45 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "WF", "roomNumber": "1304", "buildingName": "Siebel Center for Comp Sci", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "G", "lastName": "Agha", "content": "Agha, G"}}}}}
