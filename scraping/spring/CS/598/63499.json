The last two decades have witnessed the development of a rich theory in this area and deep mathematical connections have been established. The first half of the course will provide a broad introduction to games and market models, solution concepts, classical as well as recent developments in the field on equilibrium computation & complexity, mechanism design, price of anarchy, matching markets, game dynamics, and others. The second half will address a selection of advanced topics and research projects.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "S15", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "09:30 AM", "end": "10:45 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "WF", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "R", "lastName": "Mehta", "content": "Mehta, R"}}}}}
