Deutschsprachige Deb\ufffdts in der Schweizer Literatur der 1960er-Jahre   ?Rarely has so much begun? ? these are the words used in 2009 by the Neue Z\ufffdrcher Zeitung, the Swiss newspaper of record, to describe the German Swiss literature of the 1960s, a decade that saw an unprecedented emergence of new voices. While Max Frisch and Friedrich D\ufffdrrenmatt had already established themselves among the leading writers of the German-speaking world, it was authors such as Peter Bichsel, J\ufffdrg Federspiel, Hugo L\ufffdtscher, Paul Nizon, J\ufffdrg Steiner, and Otto F. Walter who now entered the literary stage for the very first time. Their d\ufffdbuts, published between 1959 und 1964, deal with the narrow-mindedness of Swiss society, Switzerland?s ?exceptional? position within Europe, and such issues as the country?s hypocritical attitude towards foreign workers or its political oppression of women. Their storylines, and especially their aesthetic novelty more than once aroused considerable controversy among literary critics, culminating in the so-called ?Z\ufffdrcher Literaturstreit? (1966), in which literary scholar Emil Staiger expressed his objections to contemporary literature. The goals of this course are to provide students with an overview of the literary topography of German Swiss literature during the 1960s, as well as insight into the political and literary discussions relevant to the works so as to make students aware how much resistance their authors had to overcome in order to give German Swiss literature after 1945 a more modern and international orientation.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "03:00 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "T", "roomNumber": "113", "buildingName": "Davenport Hall", "instructors": {}}}}
