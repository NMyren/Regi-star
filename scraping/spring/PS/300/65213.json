It offers an in depth analysis of two of the main problems confronted by organizations: collective action problems and delegation problems. Students will acquire an understanding of these problems as well as different ways in which they can be addressed. A strong emphasis is also placed on developing the analytical skills necessary for informed analysis of political interactions involving formal organizations. The most prominent characteristic that organizations have in common is the delegation of authority from the individuals to whom power to take action was originally endowed, the principal, to one or more agents. In effect, delegation is key to overcome the problems of collective action. Throughout the development of the course, we will answer questions like (1) Can we assume that subordinates do what's in the superior's best interests? Why? Why not? (2) Is the structure of an organization important? (3) What does the structure of an organization reflect? Not intended for Freshmen.
