The discipline is in a period of flux. The U.S. GPS and the Russian GLONASS are being joined by the European Galileo and the Chinese BeiDou systems. Furthermore, the prospect of a commercial UAV industry in the near future will create significant new engineering opportunities in designing and building avionics systems involving GPS. In this course, students will learn advanced satellite navigation technologies with applications in UAV flight and control systems.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "10:00 AM", "end": "11:20 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MW", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "X", "lastName": "Gao", "content": "Gao, X"}}}}}
