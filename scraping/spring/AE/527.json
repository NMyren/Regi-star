Students will be introduced to a variety of modeling techniques covering the full spectrum of length-scales from atomistics to continuum. The emphasis will be in the use of continuum-based concepts, such as the Principle of Virtual Work and conservation integrals, as bridging techniques to link atomistics and the continuum. The goal is to enable interpretation of material phenomena across different length-scales. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.
