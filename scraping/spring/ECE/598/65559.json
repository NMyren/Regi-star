This course will discuss techniques and algorithms towards building mobile sensing systems, with case studies in wearable computing, internet of things (IoT), activity and gesture recognition, indoor localization, drone flight control, and sports analytics. In one case study, students will learn about Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi decoding in the context of recognizing hand gestures from smartwatch motion data; in another study, students will learn when and how to offload computation from the phone to the cloud, to meet real-time and energy constraints. In general, the course introduces graduate students to this holistic nature of emerging computing systems, with an emphasis on how sensing interplays with computing and communications. At the end of the course, students would be expected to apply learnt techniques towards a course project that they motivate, formulate, and execute by themselves.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "03:00 PM", "end": "04:20 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MW", "roomNumber": "2013", "buildingName": "Electrical & Computer Eng Bldg", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "R", "lastName": "Roy Choudhury", "content": "Roy Choudhury, R"}}}}}
