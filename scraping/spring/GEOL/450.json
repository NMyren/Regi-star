Topics include the internal composition and dynamics of Earth, generation of Earth's gravitational and geomagnetic fields, driving mechanisms for tectonic plate motion, continental deformation, and surface topography. Students wanting a more quantitative treatment of geophysics should enroll in GEOL 452. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours. Credit is not given for both GEOL 450 and GEOL 452.
