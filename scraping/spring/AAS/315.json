Because war has been key to discourses and practices of imperialism and globalization, some questions addressed will include how these wars have impacted the nation and the global order, as well as how images about these wars produced important constructions of race, gender, and sexuality for national and cultural identities. Also examines the aftereffects of war by analyzing connections between war's trauma, race, immigration, and incarceration. Students will read critical texts, film theory, screenplays, and view films.
