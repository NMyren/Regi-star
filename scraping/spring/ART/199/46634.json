This course is open to all, and requires no prerequisites. In this course we will learn how to create our own visual language as we explore color, composition, and content. Through the completion of four or five projects we will investigate and explore the uses of paint and traditional art materials along with techniques that include collaged elements. Each of the studio assignments will address issues that broaden our knowledge of painting and the materials and techniques that are used to achieve this goal.  Through the observation and examination of the world we live in, and the experimental use of paint and other materials in our assigned projects, we will educate our eyes and learn to make visual associations that yield content and encourage further investigation.
