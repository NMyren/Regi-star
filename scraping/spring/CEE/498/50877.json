The course will draw upon and synthetize fundamental concepts from biology, ecology, fluid mechanics and morphodynamics, to apply them to truly interdisciplinary problems. Such an approach, coupled with hands-on experience involving planning, conducting and analyzing hands-on experiments at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory and field surveys on local natural waters will provide students with a broad perspective on the interconnections between physical and ecological systems. Students will apply their knowledge of fundamental processes to assess complex problems involving monitoring, management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems. Therefore, the course is well-suited for students from diverse multidisciplinary backgrounds who are interested in pursuing careers in various branches of watershed science, environmental engineering and consulting.  The course will require some level of quantitative skills ? we encourage students to check with the instructors.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "01:00 PM", "end": "02:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "1518", "buildingName": "Civil Eng Hydrosystems Lab", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "R", "lastName": "Tinoco Lopez", "content": "Tinoco Lopez, R"}}}}}
