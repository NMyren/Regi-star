These simple objects shape our lives, yet are engineering masterpieces. To unveil this hidden world the course uses a humanistic approach. Designed to appeal to all majors, it uses human stories - filled with failures and triumphs - to reveal the methods of engineers. The course enchants with tales of ancient steel making, today's pop cans, huge stone monuments, and salt. The course will change how a student looks at his or her world. Several sessions focus on women engineers and the environment.", "creditHours": "3 hours.", "sectionDegreeAttributes": "Physical Sciences course.", "genEdCategories": {"category": {"id": "NAT", "description": "Natural Sciences & Technology", "{http://rest.cis.illinois.edu}genEdAttributes": {"genEdAttribute": {"code": "1PS", "content": "UIUC: Physical Sciences"}}}}, "sections": {"section": {"href": "http://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2017/spring/CHBE/101/49101.xml", "id": "49101", "content": "WSH"}}}
