Students are charged to find challenging events each week (lectures, performances, screenings, discussions of intellectual value), contribute these ?finds to a class calendar full of possibilities, attend one of those events (not necessarily the same they contributed) and then post a written evaluation of their chosen event each week to the class blog.  Each student creates a collection of 15 different intellectual experiences with observations and responses shared with all class members as well as a final class post to summarize the evolution of the collection.
