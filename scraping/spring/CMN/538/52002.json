Each week will explore a particular concept, including readings on the notion itself, public address that exemplifies it in action, and larger theoretical projects to which it has contributed. I hope in this way to work in the middle ground between text and theory. Students will spend the semester working on a seminar paper and this should be an excellent choice for a methods requirement.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "S1 ", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "02:00 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "W", "roomNumber": "4103", "buildingName": "Lincoln Hall", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "J", "lastName": "Murphy", "content": "Murphy, J"}}}}}
