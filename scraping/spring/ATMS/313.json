Numerical models used to forecast weather are reviewed and compared. Forecasting using numerical, statistical and probabilistic forecasting techniques is studied. Forecasts of significant winter weather, convection, floods and other weather hazards are emphasized. Students learn the process behind Severe Weather Watches and Warnings, Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts, precipitation type forecasts, flood forecasts and forecasts of other significant weather.
