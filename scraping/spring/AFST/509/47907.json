This seminar examines the significance of globalism for the study of visualand material culture. How do we attach meaning to objects that have moved from one culture to another or from one context to another? How does the meaning of art change if we think of it as a thing in circulation? What exactly is a \"global\" perspective? We will examine how different disciplines consider these key questions. Subjects to be studied include: the circulation of commodities, the politics of the contemporary global art market, museums as sites of transculturation, \"border studies\" of visual culture, the current state of \"world\" art history and \"global\" studies of cultural contact. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of Africa and African visual culture in the study of globalism.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "CNF", "content": "Conference"}, "start": "04:00 PM", "end": "06:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "M", "roomNumber": "404", "buildingName": "Flagg Hall", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "S", "lastName": "Meier", "content": "Meier, S"}}}}}
