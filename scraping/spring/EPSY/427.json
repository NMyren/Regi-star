The course will focus on reading in education settings and approaches to improving reading comprehension. Students will read secondary and primary literature and have opportunities to critique, discuss, and present the findings of this research. Topics discussed will include: eye movements during reading, grammatical structures and discourse conventions of texts that support comprehension, and how comprehension and memory for text can be measured.
