Lectures and discussions will cover topics from the history of discrimination in the US education system to current best practices in teaching and outreach at the K-12 level. Guest speakers from across the University will enrich our discussions. In the laboratory portion of this course, you will work with a group of middle school students and a local community organization to solve an engineering problem that is relevant to the middle schoolers? interests and expertise. The project will result in solutions developed collaboratively through iterative prototyping using a wide range of tools available through the University and the school and discussions with the community partner.
