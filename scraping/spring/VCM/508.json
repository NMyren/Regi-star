The pathologic processes to be covered including those involved in cellular response to stress, inflammation, tissue repair, circulation and hemodynamics, immunity, cancer, and infectious disease. Translational associations that link pathologic mechanisms with disease manifestations commonly encountered in companion animal veterinary practice will be emphasized and will promote comprehensive bench-to-bedside learning.", "creditHours": "3 hours.", "classScheduleInformation": "Graduate students only.
