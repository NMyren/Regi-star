Interrogates how national and transnational identities (at home and abroad), modernites, histories, and colonial and global narratives are built on ideas of racialized sexualities, and as such, is particularly interested in the study of queer diaspora. Importantly, this course utilizes transnational feminist frameworks for re-thinking issues related to sexuality, immigration, nation-building, race and gender. Areas of inquiry include imperialism, immigration, war, tourism and globalization. Same as HIST 385.
