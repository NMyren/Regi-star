Specifically, we will consider the cultural distinctions between animals considered \"pets\" and those considered \"food\" animals, both in U.S. and international contexts. Students will combine hands-on experiential learning at a local animal shelter with scholarly reflection, and will conduct original problem- solving research, which will be presented in a format designed to engage a wider community outside the classroom.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "09:30 AM", "end": "10:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "J", "lastName": "Desmond", "content": "Desmond, J"}}}}}
