Questions of musical style, aesthetics, repertoire formation, and social-geographic setting will be addressed, as will the cultural meanings that the string quartet accrued in its European and American contexts. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a topic for a final research paper. They will also undertake listening, score-study, and reading assignments; attend and critique at least one string quartet recital on campus; and contribute to weekly class discussion.
