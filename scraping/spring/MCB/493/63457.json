This laboratory course is built upon the experimental foundation introduced in MCB 253. Biochemical, immunological and molecular biological techniques will be used to probe the molecules and processes of eukaryotic cells. Special emphasis will be given to the cell cycle, intracellular trafficking, and cellular differentiation. The course will also include proper data handling and reporting techniques. This course counts as an advanced MCB laboratory course. This section may not be repeated.
