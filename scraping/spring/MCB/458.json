Basic biological processes will be stressed including tissue adaptation, injury, inflammation, repair and neoplasia. Pathology synthesizes cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry and immunology holistically so as to understand the body's limited responses to the cornucopia of experienced physiological insults. 3 undergraduate hours.
