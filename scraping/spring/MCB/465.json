Disruption of metabolic and energy homeostasis plays key roles leading to metabolic disorders. We will examine how lipid/glucose levels and energy balance are controlled in health and how they are abnormally regulated in disease sates. In addition, we will cover current topics related to control of metabolism including aging and circadian rhythms. Methodologies leading to scientific discoveries and potential preventive and therapeutic agents will also be discussed. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours.
