Intellectual property (IP) of various types (patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, etc.) can confer valuable rights over these knowledge assets, which makes intellectual property strategy a vital skill in the modern manager's professional toolkit. This course provides an introduction to different IP types and an in-depth exploration of the strategic issues entailed in using (obtained, licensing and enforcing) IP rights in business. It examines how IP strategies can be used to support the company's overall strategy, and how the two can be better aligned.
