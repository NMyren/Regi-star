Over the course of the past three and a half centuries, European development - cultural, economic, social, political, and intellectual - has had an enormous impact on shaping the world we live in today.  European history has also been vital to the creation of what we think of as \"identity\":  how we define and describe ourselves, and how we define and describe others.  This semester, while learning how events, ideologies, and \"isms\" (nationalism, imperialism, fascism, feminism, etc.) have contributed to the evolution of European history, we will be paying particular attention to the exploration of one central concern\"  the construction of our own uniquely modern identities.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "09:00 AM", "end": "09:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "T", "lastName": "Chaplin", "content": "Chaplin, T"}}}}}
