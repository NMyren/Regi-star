As a historian of urban riots, I propose to help us work through a long history of racal violence--from the amalgamation riots of the 1830s to the Red Summer of the 1910s Great Migration to the Urban Crisis of 1967, and from the multicultural clashes of the 1990s Rodney King riots to the rise of Black Lives Matter.  The purpose is to develop deeper understanding of how urban conflict and violence has both persisted and yet also dramatically changed, and to provide class participants with a historically-based vision of race and racism in contemporary America.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "05:00 PM", "end": "06:20 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "221", "buildingName": "Gregory Hall", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "K", "lastName": "Mumford", "content": "Mumford, K"}}}}}
