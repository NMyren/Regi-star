In the decades since, women and men in China, Korea, Japan, the United States and elsewhere have wrestled with their individual memories and collective histories of those tumultuous years. How have these events been portrayed in memoirs, literature, and film? What has been left out? How do historical documents, literature, and film reflect and shape personal memories and national histories of the war? How are memory and history similar and different? We will grapple with these and other questions by reading a variety of written accounts of the Asia-Pacific War as well as watch and discuss films produced both during and after the war.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "01:00 PM", "end": "02:20 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MW", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "R", "lastName": "Wilson", "content": "Wilson, R"}}}}}
