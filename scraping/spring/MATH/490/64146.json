Introduction to computational techniques from stochastic calculus, with particular focus on quantitative risk management. Equity-linked insurance products are hybrids of traditional life insurance and  financial derivatives. The challenges from the modeling and risk management of these products stem from complex guaranteed benefits, dynamic policyholder behavior, and the interaction of mortality and financial risks. The course is aimed at upper level undergraduate students and graduate students wishing to extend their knowledge and math tools applicable to  finance, insurance and risk management. Studentswill be able to learn various mathematical models and techniques to quantify, assess, and manage risks and uncertainty.  Restricted to Actuarial Science seniors through Nov. 4.
