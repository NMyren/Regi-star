Metric space topics include continuity, compactness, completeness, connectedness and uniform convergence. Analysis topics include the theory of differentiation, Riemann-Darboux integration, sequences and series of functions, and interchange of limiting operations. As part of the honors sequence, this course will be rigorous and abstract. 3 undergraduate hours. No graduate credit. Credit is not given for both Math 424 and either Math 444 or Math 447. Approved for honors grading.
