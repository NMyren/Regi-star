This course will give students a working knowledge of the AdS/QFT correspondence, and its applications in particle physics, hydrodynamics, fluid mechanics, and condensed matter physics. Although students will benefit from having already a good knowledge of quantum field theory (such as from Physics 582-583), all other necessary material will be introduced in class, including rudimentary material on general relativity and string theory. Throughout the course, we will collaboratively develop code using Mathematica and/or Matlab to calculate interesting holographic observables.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LEC", "content": "Lecture"}, "start": "03:30 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "158", "buildingName": "Loomis Laboratory", "instructors": {}}}}
