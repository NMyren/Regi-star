Students will have the opportunity to observe or participate in activities such as wildlife marking, waterbird identification, focal and scan sampling, radio telemetry, wetland sampling, and other research techniques. Five lectures will be required during the semester (2:00-3:50 pm February 13, 20, 27, March 6, 13) and will be followed by a 5-day field trip to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers (during the week of SPRING BREAK, Saturday, March 18-Wednesday, March 22). Students will tour wetlands and several field stations while in the vicinity of Havana, Illinois and the Forbes Biological Station. Students will accompany scientists from the Illinois Natural History survey where they will observe and participate in active wetland and waterbird research projects.  Upon completion of this course, students will have gained a greater understanding of wetland and waterbird ecology and management and of the conservation, research, and monitoring activities of various government and non-government organizations in North America.  Students will also be introduced to wetland conservation policy and tour wetlands of international importance (e.g., RAMSAR) along with those restored and managed through NAWCA and USDA Farm Bill programs. A field trip fee to cover transportation and lodging will be charged for this course, and students will be expected to pay for their meals on the trip.
