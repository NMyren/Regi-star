Draws upon and synthetize fundamental concepts from biology, ecology, fluid mechanics and morphodynamics, to apply them to truly interdisciplinary problems. Such an approach, coupled with hands-on experience involving planning, conducting and analyzing hands-on experiments at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory and field surveys on local natural waters will provide the students with a broad perspective on the interconnections between physical and ecological systems. Students will apply their knowledge of fundamental processes to assess complex problems involving monitoring, management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.", "creditHours": "4 hours.", "courseSectionInformation": "4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.", "sections": {"section": {"href": "http://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2017/spring/GEOG/459/65729.xml", "id": "65729", "content": "EH"}}}
