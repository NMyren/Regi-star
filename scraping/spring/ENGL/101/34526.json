Furthermore, it introduces students to the ways we write and make arguments about poetry.  The course addresses the basics of prosody, aspects of poetic language (such as diction, metaphor, image, tone), and major verse forms (such as the sonnet, elegy, ode, ballad, dramatic monologue, free verse).  In addition to the formal qualities of poetry, students will also study poems from a range of literary periods and movements in order to learn how these formal qualities change and develop over time as well as how poems are both shaped by and, in some cases, even manage to shape their (and perhaps our) world. Students will write twelve to fifteen pages of interpretation or criticism, spread out over two or more essays, and also take a midterm and a final examination.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "11:00 AM", "end": "11:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MWF", "roomNumber": "131", "buildingName": "English Building", "instructors": {}}}}
