Film is by definition an audiovisual medium and, even if we may not be consciously aware of it, decisions about cinematography, editing, mise-en-sc\ufffdne, and sound affect us. Simply put: How we look at films is determined by how films look.  One primary goal of this course, therefore, is to deepen your understanding of the various cinematic tools used in film storytelling and of how film scholars categorize and analyze them. We will discuss the choices that filmmakers have made and how those choices reflect three primary influences: institutional goals, political aims, and conceptions of the relationship between a film and its spectators. With that last element in mind, a second important goal of this course is to help you to be more aware of ways in which filmmakers invite us to participate in the experience that they have created for us and of what happens to us when we accept or reject that invitation. Evaluated work includes three medium-length papers and several shorter ones, as well as active participation in class discussion. While experience in film studies is a plus, it is not required for enrollment in this course.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "03:00 PM", "end": "04:50 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "MW", "roomNumber": "148", "buildingName": "Armory", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "S", "lastName": "Camargo", "content": "Camargo, S"}}}}}
