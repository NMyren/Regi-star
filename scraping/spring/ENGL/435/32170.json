But in British fiction, this process of discovery and growth is often complicated by nostalgia and fears of loss. Sometimes the characters discover that what they were looking for was in front of them all along, or find they can never truly untangle the dark origins of the problems that entrap them. In this class, we?ll be focusing on this particular mixture of romance, Bildungsroman, the detective story, and Gothic historicism. Our readings will include Jane Austen?s Emma, Charles Dickens?s Bleak House, Emily Bront\ufffd?s Wuthering Heights, Wilkie Collins?s The Moonstone, Oscar Wilde?s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Joseph Conrad?s Heart of Darkness. These novels are tremendously fun to read, but also very long, so be prepared for a great deal of reading (both fiction and secondary criticism). The course will require one close-reading paper, one research paper, a midterm and final, weekly written assignments, and active class participation.", "sectionNotes": "Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "CrossListOpen (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "11:00 AM", "end": "12:15 PM", "daysOfTheWeek": "TR", "roomNumber": "115", "buildingName": "English Building", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "E", "lastName": "Courtemanche", "content": "Courtemanche, E"}}}}}
