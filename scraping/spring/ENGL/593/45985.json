The seminar will focus on lesson planning, creating audio-visual toolkits, moderating discussions, crafting assignments, and other pedagogical issues. We will therefore focus on four principle undertakings: 1) drawing up lesson plans around a textbook and learning to augment them with information from other sources; 2) making persuasive audio-visual material that illuminate the technical and critical aspects of cinema; 3) sharpening a teaching philosophy that informs the whole pedagogic project and clarifies why a study of cinema is important in our media driven age; and 4) practical matters like effective syllabi and assignments. By the end of the semester, participants will have a portfolio of key documents and digital material that will be of practical use in the teaching of film and in the presentation of a competitive teaching profile in the academic job market.", "partOfTerm": "1", "sectionStatusCode": "A", "enrollmentStatus": "Open (Restricted)", "startDate": "2017-01-17-06:00", "endDate": "2017-05-03-05:00", "meetings": {"meeting": {"id": "0", "type": {"code": "LCD", "content": "Lecture-Discussion"}, "start": "10:00 AM", "end": "11:50 AM", "daysOfTheWeek": "T", "instructors": {"instructor": {"firstName": "A", "lastName": "Basu", "content": "Basu, A"}}}}}
